Never one to beat around the bush, he explains to us, in the opening of this singular, delightfully eccentric book, that because he is also a cartoonist at the magazine he actually has two of the best jobs in the world. With the help of myriad images and his funniest, most beloved cartoons, he traces his love of the craft all the way back to his childhood, when he started doing funny drawings at the age of eight. After meeting his mother, we follow his unlikely stints as a high-school basketball star, draft dodger, and sociology grad student. Though Mankoff abandoned the study of psychology in the seventies to become a cartoonist, he recently realized that the field he abandoned could help him better understand the field he was in, and here he takes up the psychology of cartooning, analyzing why some cartoons make us laugh and others don't. He allows us into the hallowed halls of The New Yorker to show us the soup-to-nuts process of cartoon creation, giving us a detailed look not only at his own work, but that of the other talented cartoonists who keep us laughing week after week. For desert, he reveals the secrets to winning the magazine's caption contest. Throughout How About Never--Is Never Good for You?, we see his commitment to the motto \"Anything worth saying is worth saying funny.\"", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "080509590X"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780805095906"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 304, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 4.0, "ratingsCount": 8, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=djdtnQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=djdtnQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=djdtnQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:080509590X&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=djdtnQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:080509590X&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/How_About_Never_Is_Never_Good_for_You.html?hl=&id=djdtnQEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=djdtnQEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "For desert, he reveals the secrets to winning the magazine&#39;s caption contest.

Don't hurt people, and don't take their stuff. Simple and straightforward, that's liberty in a nutshell\u2014no assembly required. And yet it seems like, more and more, the decisions Washington makes about what to do for us, or to us, or even against us, are having an increasingly adverse impact on our lives. Young people can't find jobs, millions of Americans are losing the health care plans they were promised they could keep, and every one of us is somehow being targeted, monitored, snooped on, conscripted, induced, taxed, subsidized, regulated, or otherwise manipulated by someone else's agenda, based on someone else's decisions made in some secret meeting or closed-door legislative deal. What gives? Our government is out of control. But setting things right again requires that you step up and take your freedom back. From Matt Kibbe, the influential leader of FreedomWorks, Don't Hurt People and Don't Take Their Stuff is the first true manifesto of a new libertarian grassroots movement. As political powermongers and crony corporatists in Washington continue to consolidate their control and infringe on our most fundamental liberties, Kibbe makes the libertarian case for freer people, more voluntary cooperation, and solving problems from the bottom up. He calls out the tyranny of faceless bureaucrats with too much power and discretion, laying out a clear road map for restoring liberty. A witty yet piercing critique of government's expanding control over you and your future, Don't Hurt People and Don't Take Their Stuff is a vital read for all those who cherish personal liberty and the unalienable right to choose your own path in life.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0062308254"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780062308252"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 272, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Political Science"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rbaqnAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rbaqnAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=rbaqnAEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0062308254&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=rbaqnAEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0062308254&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Don_t_Hurt_People_and_Don_t_Take_Their_S.html?hl=&id=rbaqnAEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=rbaqnAEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "From Matt Kibbe, the influential leader of FreedomWorks, Don&#39;t Hurt People and Don&#39;t Take Their Stuff is the first true manifesto of a new libertarian grassroots movement."}}]}

Then came SuperFreakonomics, a documentary film, an award-winning podcast, and more. Now, with Think Like a Freak, Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner have written their most revolutionary book yet. With their trademark blend of captivating storytelling and unconventional analysis, they take us inside their thought process and teach us all to think a bit more productively, more creatively, more rationally\u2014to think, that is, like a Freak. Levitt and Dubner offer a blueprint for an entirely new way to solve problems, whether your interest lies in minor lifehacks or major global reforms. As always, no topic is off-limits. They range from business to philanthropy to sports to politics, all with the goal of retraining your brain. Along the way, you'll learn the secrets of a Japanese hot-dog-eating champion, the reason an Australian doctor swallowed a batch of dangerous bacteria, and why Nigerian e-mail scammers make a point of saying they're from Nigeria. Some of the steps toward thinking like a Freak: First, put away your moral compass\u2014because it's hard to see a problem clearly if you've already decided what to do about it. Learn to say \"I don't know\"\u2014for until you can admit what you don't yet know, it's virtually impossible to learn what you need to. Think like a child\u2014because you'll come up with better ideas and ask better questions. Take a master class in incentives\u2014because for better or worse, incentives rule our world. Learn to persuade people who don't want to be persuaded\u2014because being right is rarely enough to carry the day. Learn to appreciate the upside of quitting\u2014because you can't solve tomorrow's problem if you aren't willing to abandon today's dud. Levitt and Dubner plainly see the world like no one else. Now you can too. Never before have such iconoclastic thinkers been so revealing\u2014and so much fun to read.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0062218336"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780062218339"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 288, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "averageRating": 4.0, "ratingsCount": 33, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4yuWlwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4yuWlwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=4yuWlwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0062218336&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=4yuWlwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0062218336&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Think_Like_a_Freak.html?hl=&id=4yuWlwEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=4yuWlwEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Then came SuperFreakonomics, a documentary film, an award-winning podcast, and more.

Not long after the death of his father, Charles Koch, then in his early 30s, discovered a letter the family patriarch had written to his sons. \"You will receive what now seems to be a large sum of money,\" Fred Koch cautioned. \"It may either be a blessing or a curse.\" Fred's legacy would become a blessing and a curse to his four sons-Frederick, Charles, and fraternal twins David and Bill-who in the ensuing decades fought bitterly over their birthright, the oil and cattle-ranching empire their father left behind in 1967. Against a backdrop of scorched-earth legal skirmishes, Charles and David built Koch Industries into one of the largest private corporations in the world-bigger than Boeing and Disney-and they rose to become two of the wealthiest men on the planet. Influenced by the sentiments of their father, who was present at the birth of the John Birch Society, Charles and David have spent decades trying to remake the American political landscape and mainline their libertarian views into the national bloodstream. They now control a machine that is a center of gravity within the Republican Party. To their supporters, they are liberating America from the scourge of Big Government. To their detractors, they are political \"contract killers,\" as David Axelrod, President Barack Obama's chief strategist, put it during the 2012 campaign. Bill, meanwhile, built a multi-billion dollar energy empire all his own, and earned notoriety as an America's Cup-winning yachtsman, a flamboyant playboy, and as a litigious collector of fine wine and Western memorabilia. Frederick lived an intensely private life as an arts patron, refurbishing a series of historic homes and estates. SONS OF WICHITA traces the complicated lives and legacies of these four tycoons, as well as their business, social, and political ambitions. No matter where you fall on the ideological spectrum, the Kochs are one of the most influential dynasties of our era, but so little is publicly known about this family, their origins, how they make their money, and how they live their lives. Based on hundreds of interviews with friends, relatives, business associates, and many others, SONS OF WICHITA is the first major biography about this wealthy and powerful family-warts and all.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1455518735"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781455518739"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 432, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 3.0, "ratingsCount": 4, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gk1ZvgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gk1ZvgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=gk1ZvgEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1455518735&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=gk1ZvgEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1455518735&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Sons_of_Wichita.html?hl=&id=gk1ZvgEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=gk1ZvgEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "SONS OF WICHITA traces the complicated lives and legacies of these four tycoons, as well as their business, social, and political ambitions."}}]}

Thirteen years ago, Bill and Hillary Clinton left the White House under a cloud, dogged by sordid sexual scandals, a series of highly compromising investigations, and last-minute pardons that won widespread bipartisan condemnation. Even many Democrats were glad to see them go. Yet within just a few years Bill had secured a new reputation as a global humanitarian and Democratic Party elder statesman, and Hillary was running for president. Despite her 2008 loss to Barack Obama, Hillary bounced back to become one of the most powerful and respected figures in his cabinet. Along the way, she and Bill have gone from being virtually penniless to millionaires many times over. Today the Clintons are among the most popular politicians in America\u2014respected and feared by Republicans and Democrats alike. Their transformation has been so complete that it takes an effort to recall just how low their fortunes were a decade ago. Hillary is already the presumptive frontrunner for 2016, while Bill jets around the world dispensing advice, making deals and collecting huge fees. Meanwhile, Chelsea Clinton has emerged as a formidable public figure in her own right. None of this happened by accident. Behind the Clintons' remarkable comeback is an untold story of strategic calculation, backroom deals, reckless gambles, and an unquenchable thirst for wealth and power. In Clinton, Inc., Weekly Standard reporter Daniel Halper compiles a wealth of research, exclusive documents, and candid interviews with former Clinton administration officials, senators, congressmen, friends, allies, and former enemies of the Clintons to reveal how they rebuilt their reputations, reconstructed their political machine, and positioned themselves for even greater success. Clinton, Inc. describes in intimate detail how the Bill and Hillary partnership works: they are, in effect, dual CEOs of a single enterprise, often playing both sides of the street, sometimes at odds with each other, but always focused on the ultimate goal of reclaiming political power. Halper provides new insights into their deals with Barack Obama and the inner workings of their surprising friendship with the Bush family; how the Clintons managed to pacify their once most bitter enemies; how Bill and Hillary are laying the groundwork for Hillary's upcoming presidential campaign; and how Vice President Biden and other Democrats are trying to maneuver around her. He reveals the Clintons' plans for Chelsea's future and the lengths to which they will go to protect her carefully cultivated image. Halper also reveals the secrets of the Clintons' skillful media management, the survival of the Clintons' marriage, as well as the Clintons' financial backers and hidden corporate enterprises. The book also discusses a comprehensive Republican effort to bring their ambitions to a halt. Compulsively readable and filled with juicy scoops and inside information, Clinton, Inc. is the key to understanding America's most powerful political couple.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0062311239"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780062311238"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 352, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Political Science"], "averageRating": 3.0, "ratingsCount": 2, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EFK5ngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EFK5ngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=EFK5ngEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0062311239&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=EFK5ngEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0062311239&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Clinton_Inc.html?hl=&id=EFK5ngEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=EFK5ngEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The book also discusses a comprehensive Republican effort to bring their ambitions to a halt."}}]}

What the nation\u2019s leaders are really like and what goes on behind the scenes remains hidden. Secret Service agents have a front row seat on their private lives and those of their wives and children. Crammed with new, headline-making revelations, THE FIRST FAMILY DETAIL: Secret Service Agents Reveal the Hidden Lives of the Presidents by Ronald Kessler tells that eye-opening, uncensored story. Since publication of his New York Times bestselling book In the President\u2019s Secret Service, award-winning investigative reporter Ronald Kessler has continued to penetrate the wall of secrecy that surrounds the U.S. Secret Service, breaking the story that Secret Service agents who were to protect President Obama hired prostitutes in Cartagena, Colombia and revealing that the Secret Service allowed a third uninvited guest to crash a White House state dinner. Now in this new book, Kessler presents far bigger and more consequential stories about our nation\u2019s leaders and the agency sworn to protect them. Kessler widens his scope to include presidential candidates and former presidents after they leave the White House. In particular, he focuses on first ladies and their children and their relationships with the presidents. From observing Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s reckless behavior that jeopardizes the country\u2019s safety, to escorting Bill Clinton\u2019s blond mistress at Chappaqua, to overhearing First Lady Michelle Obama\u2019s admonitions to the president, to witnessing President Nixon\u2019s friends bring him a nude stripper, to seeing their own agency take risks that could result in an assassination, Secret Service agents know a secret world that Ronald Kessler exposes in breathtaking detail. THE FIRST FAMILY DETAIL reveals: \u00b7 Vice President Joe Biden regularly orders the Secret Service to keep his military aide with the nuclear football a mile behind his motorcade, potentially leaving the country unable to retaliate in the event of a nuclear attack. \u00b7 Secret Service agents discovered that former president Bill Clinton has a blond mistress who lives near the Clintons\u2019 home in Chappaqua, New York. Within minutes of Hillary Clinton\u2019s leaving, the woman\u2014codenamed Energizer by agents\u2014shows up to be with Bill and stays every day while the likely future presidential candidate is away. \u00b7 The Secret Service covered up the fact that President Ronald Reagan\u2019s White House staff overruled the Secret Service to let unscreened spectators get close to Reagan as he left the Washington Hilton, allowing John W. Hinckley Jr. to shoot the president. \u00b7 Secret Service agents have been dismayed to overhear Michelle Obama push her husband to be more aggressive in attacking Republicans and to side with blacks in racial controversies. \u00b7 Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan diverted agents from protecting President Obama and his family at the White House and ordered them instead to protect his assistant at her home and illegally retrieve confidential law enforcement records as a favor to her. \u00b7 Because Hillary Clinton is so nasty to agents, being assigned to her protective detail is considered a form of punishment and the worst assignment in the Secret Service. \u00b7 Secret Service agents were ordered to ignore security rules and allow the SUV carrying actor Bradley Cooper to drive unscreened into a secure restricted area when President Obama was about to deliver his speech at the White House Correspondents Dinner. \u00b7 Vice President Joe Biden has racked up costs to taxpayers of a million dollars to fly to and from his home in Delaware on Air Force Two. His office tried to cover up the costs of the personal trips. \u00b7 Because the Secret Service refused to provide enough magnetometers at his campaign events, Mitt Romney regularly left himself open to assassination by giving speeches to crowds that had not been screened. \u00b7 Vice President Joe Biden swims nude at the vice president\u2019s residence in Washington and at his home in Delaware, offending female Secret Service agents.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780804139212"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0804139210"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 258, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "averageRating": 2.5, "ratingsCount": 10, "maturityRating": "MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VEaqBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VEaqBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=VEaqBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:0804139210&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=VEaqBAAAQBAJ&dq=isbn:0804139210&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_First_Family_Detail.html?hl=&id=VEaqBAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=VEaqBAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Now in this new book, Kessler presents far bigger and more consequential stories about our nation\u2019s leaders and the agency sworn to protect them."}}]}

The world's leading expert on self-control, Walter Mischel has proven that the ability to delay gratification is critical for a successful life, predicting higher SAT scores, better social and cognitive functioning, a healthier lifestyle and a greater sense of self-worth.

In The Marshmallow Test, Mischel explains how self-control can be mastered and applied to challenges in everyday life--from weight control to quitting smoking, overcoming heartbreak, making major decisions, and planning for retirement.

Russia is in the midst of a rapid economic and geopolitical renaissance under the rule of Vladimir Putin, a tenacious KGB officer turned modern-day tsar. Understanding his rise to power provides the keys to understanding the shift in the energy trade from Saudi Arabia to Russia. This powerful new position threatens to unravel the political dominance of the United States once and for all. Discover how political coups, hostile takeovers, and assassinations have brought Russia to the center of the world's energy market Follow Putin's rise to power and how it has led to an upsetting of the global balance of trade Learn how Russia toppled a generation of robber barons and positioned itself as the most powerful force in the energy market Study Putin's long-range plans and their potential impact on the United States and the U.S. dollar If Putin's plans are successful, not only will Russia be able to starve other countries of power, but the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) will replace the G7 in wealth and clout.

Jensen, MD, offers a revolutionary look at the adolescent brain, providing remarkable insights that translate into practical advice both for parents and teenagers. Driven by the assumption that brain growth was almost complete by the time a child reached puberty, scientists believed for many years that the adolescent brain was essentially an adult one\u2014only with fewer miles on it. Over the last decade, however, neurology and neuroscience have revealed that the teen years encompass vitally important stages of brain development. Motivated by her experience of parenting two teenagers, renowned neurologist Frances E. Jensen, MD, gathers what we've discovered about adolescent brain functioning and wiring, and in this groundbreaking, accessible book, explains how these eye-opening findings not only dispel commonly held myths about teens but also yield practical suggestions for adults and teenagers negotiating the mysterious and magical world of adolescent biology. Interweaving clear summary and analysis of research data with anecdotes drawn from her years as a clinician, researcher, and public speaker, Dr. Jensen explores adolescent brain functioning and development in the context of learning and multitasking, stress and memory, sleep, addiction, and decision making. Examining data connecting substance use to lingering memory issues and, sometimes, a lower adult IQ, The Teenage Brain explains why teenagers are not as resilient to the effects of drugs as we previously thought; reveals how multitasking impacts learning ability and concentration; and examines the consequences of stress on mental health during and beyond adolescence. Rigorous yet accessible, warm yet direct, The Teenage Brain sheds new light on the brains\u2014and behaviors\u2014of adolescents and young adults, and analyzes this knowledge to share specific ways in which parents, educators, and even the legal system can help them navigate their way more smoothly into adulthood in our ever challenging world.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0062067842"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780062067845"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 384, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Psychology"], "averageRating": 4.5, "ratingsCount": 3, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Fl8OnwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Fl8OnwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=Fl8OnwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0062067842&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=Fl8OnwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0062067842&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Teenage_Brain.html?hl=&id=Fl8OnwEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Fl8OnwEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "In The Teenage Brain, Dr. Jensen brings to readers the astonishing findings that previously remained buried in academic journals."}}]}

Sonic Youth is one of the most influential and successful bands to emerge from the post-punk New York scene, and their legacy continues to loom large over the landscape of indie rock and American pop culture. Almost as celebrated as the band's defiantly dissonant sound was the marriage between Gordon and her husband, fellow Sonic Youth founder and lead guitarist Thurston Moore. So when Matador Records released a statement in the fall of 2011 announcing that\u2014after twenty-seven years\u2014the two were splitting, fans were devastated. In the middle of a crazy world, they'd seemed so solid. What did this mean? What comes next? What came before? In Girl in a Band, the famously reserved superstar speaks candidly about her past and the future. From her childhood in the sunbaked suburbs of Southern California, growing up with a mentally ill sibling who often sapped her family of emotional capital, to New York's downtown art and music scene in the eighties and nineties and the birth of a band that would pave the way for acts like Nirvana, as well as help inspire the Riot Grrl generation, here is an edgy and evocative portrait of a life in art. Exploring the artists, musicians, and writers who influenced Gordon, and the relationship that defined her life for so long, Girl in a Band is filled with the sights and sounds of a pre-Internet world and is a deeply personal portrait of a woman who has become an icon.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0062295896"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780062295897"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 288, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 1541, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gK6SrgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gK6SrgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=gK6SrgEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0062295896&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=gK6SrgEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0062295896&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Girl_in_a_Band.html?hl=&id=gK6SrgEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=gK6SrgEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Telling the story of her family, growing up in California in the &#39;60s and &#39;70s, her life in visual art, her move to New York City, the men in her life, her marriage, her relationship with her daughter, her music, and her band, Girl in a ..."}}]}

Your online and in-store purchasing patterns are recorded, and reveal if you're unemployed, sick, or pregnant. Your e-mails and texts expose your intimate and casual friends. Google knows what you\u2019re thinking because it saves your private searches. Facebook can determine your sexual orientation without you ever mentioning it. The powers that surveil us do more than simply store this information. Corporations use surveillance to manipulate not only the news articles and advertisements we each see, but also the prices we\u2019re offered. Governments use surveillance to discriminate, censor, chill free speech, and put people in danger worldwide. And both sides share this information with each other or, even worse, lose it to cybercriminals in huge data breaches. Much of this is voluntary: we cooperate with corporate surveillance because it promises us convenience, and we submit to government surveillance because it promises us protection. The result is a mass surveillance society of our own making. But have we given up more than we\u2019ve gained?

The passengers were surprisingly at ease, even though Germany had declared the seas around Britain to be a war zone. For months, German U-boats had brought terror to the North Atlantic. But the Lusitania was one of the era\u2019s great transatlantic \u201cGreyhounds\u201d\u2014the fastest liner then in service\u2014and her captain, William Thomas Turner, placed tremendous faith in the gentlemanly strictures of warfare that for a century had kept civilian ships safe from attack.

A modern alloy of Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Howard Hughes, and Steve Jobs, Musk is the man behind PayPal, Tesla Motors, SpaceX, and SolarCity, each of which has sent shock waves throughout American business and industry. More than any other executive today, Musk has dedicated his energies and his own vast fortune to inventing a future that is as rich and far-reaching as a science fiction fantasy. In this lively, investigative account, veteran technology journalist Ashlee Vance offers an unprecedented look into the remarkable life and times of Silicon Valley's most audacious businessman. Written with exclusive access to Musk, his family, and his friends, the book traces his journey from his difficult upbringing in South Africa to his ascent to the pinnacle of the global business world. Vance spent more than fifty hours in conversation with Musk and interviewed close to three hundred people to tell the tumultuous stories of Musk's world-changing companies and to paint a portrait of a complex man who has renewed American industry and sparked new levels of innovation\u2014all while making plenty of enemies along the way. In 1992, Elon Musk arrived in the United States as a ferociously driven immigrant bent on realizing his wildest dreams. Since then, Musk's roller-coaster life has brought him grave disappointments alongside massive successes. After being forced out of PayPal, fending off a life-threatening case of malaria, and dealing with the death of his infant son, Musk abandoned Silicon Valley for Los Angeles. He spent the next few years baffling his friends by blowing his entire fortune on rocket ships and electric cars. Cut to 2012, however, and Musk had mounted one of the greatest resurrections in business history: Tesla, SpaceX, and SolarCity had enjoyed unparalleled success, and Musk's net worth soared to more than $5 billion. At a time when many American companies are more interested in chasing easy money than in taking bold risks on radical new technology, Musk stands out as the only businessman with enough dynamism and vision to tackle\u2014and even revolutionize\u2014three industries at once.

By taking us back to the epic struggle between Andrew Jackson and Chief John Ross, Inskeep tells an essential story of geography, greed, and power: and the forces he so clearly delineates are the ones that shape us still.\" Jacksonland is the thrilling narrative history of two men--President Andrew Jackson and Cherokee chief John Ross--who led their respective nations at a crossroads of American history. Five decades after the Revolutionary War, the United States approached a constitutional crisis. At its center stood two former military comrades locked in a struggle that tested the boundaries of our fledgling democracy. Jacksonland is their story. One man we recognize: Andrew Jackson--war hero, populist, and exemplar of the expanding South--whose first major initiative as president instigated the massive expulsion of Native Americans known as the Trail of Tears. The other is a half-forgotten figure: John Ross--a mixed-race Cherokee politician and diplomat--who used the United States' own legal system and democratic ideals to oppose Jackson. Representing one of the Five Civilized Tribes who had adopted the ways of white settlers--cultivating farms, publishing a newspaper in their own language, and sending children to school--Ross championed the tribes' cause all the way to the Supreme Court. He gained allies like Senator Henry Clay, Chief Justice John Marshall, and even Davy Crockett. In a fight that seems at once distant and familiar, Ross and his allies made their case in the media, committed civil disobedience, and benefited from the first mass political action by American women. Their struggle contained ominous overtures of later events like the Civil War and set the pattern for modern-day politics. At stake in this struggle was the land of the Five Civilized Tribes. In shocking detail, Jacksonland reveals how Jackson, as a general, extracted immense wealth from his own armies' conquest of native lands. Later, as president, Jackson set in motion the seizure of tens of millions of acres--\"Jacksonland\"--in today's Deep South. Jacksonland is the work of renowned journalist Steve Inskeep, cohost of NPR's Morning Edition, who offers here a heart-stopping narrative masterpiece, a tragedy of American history that feels ripped from the headlines in its immediacy, drama, and relevance to our lives. Harrowing, inspiring, and deeply moving, Inskeep's Jacksonland is the story of America at a moment of transition, when the fate of states and nations was decided by the actions of two heroic yet tragically opposed men. CANDICE MILLARD, author of Destiny of the Republic and The River of Doubt \"Inskeep tells this, one of the most tragic and transformative stories in American history, in swift, confident, colorful strokes. So well, and so intimately, does he know his subject that the reader comes away feeling as if Jackson and Ross's epic struggle for the future of their nations took place yesterday rather than nearly two hundred years ago.\"", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1594205566"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781594205569"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 448, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cMnzoQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cMnzoQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=cMnzoQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1594205566&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=cMnzoQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1594205566&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Jacksonland.html?hl=&id=cMnzoQEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=cMnzoQEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "A renowned journalist and cohost of NPR&#39;s Morning Edition presents a thrilling narrative history of President Andrew Jackson and Cherokee Chief John Ross--two heroic yet tragically opposed men whose actions decided the fate of states and ..."}}]}

Drawing on her background in anthropology and primatology, she tried looking at her new world through that lens, and suddenly things fell into place. She understood the other mothers\u2019 snobbiness at school drop-off when she compared them to olive baboons. Her obsessional quest for a Hermes Birkin handbag made sense when she realized other females wielded them to establish dominance in their troop.

Dispensing with myths to achieve an intimate and evenhanded look at the actual man, Evan Thomas delivers the best single-volume biography of Nixon to date, a radical, unique portrait of a complicated figure who was both determinedly optimistic and tragically flawed. What drove a painfully shy outcast in elite Washington society a man so self-conscious he refused to make eye contact during meetings to pursue power and public office? How did a president so attuned to the American political id that he won reelection in a historic landslide lack the self-awareness to recognize the gaping character flaws that would drive him from office and forever taint his legacy? In \"Being Nixon, \" Evan Thomas peels away the layers of the complex, confounding figure who became America s thirty-seventh president. The son of devout Quakers, Richard Nixon (not unlike his rival John F. Kennedy) grew up in the shadow of an older, favored brother and thrived on conflict and opposition. Through high school and college, in the navy and in politics, he was constantly leading crusades and fighting off enemies real and imagined. As maudlin as he was Machiavellian, Nixon possessed the plainspoken eloquence to reduce American television audiences to tears with his career-saving Checkers speech; meanwhile, his darker half hatched schemes designed to take down his political foes, earning him the notorious nickname Tricky Dick. Drawing on a wide range of historical accounts, Thomas reveals the contradictions of a leader whose vision and foresight led him to achieve detente with the Soviet Union and reestablish relations with communist China, but whose underhanded political tactics tainted his reputation long before the Watergate scandal. One of the principal architects of the modern Republican Party and its silent majority of disaffected whites and conservative ex-Dixiecrats, Nixon was also deemed a liberal in some quarters for his efforts to desegregate Southern schools, create the Environmental Protection Agency, and end the draft. A deeply insightful character study as well as a brilliant political biography, \"Being Nixon\" offers a surprising look at a man capable of great bravery and extraordinary deviousness a balanced portrait of a president too often reduced to caricature. Advance praise for\" Being Nixon\" The great Evan Thomas has brought us a measured, concise, and important American biography. Now that the shouting and tumult have faded and Richard Nixon moves from our contemporary politics toward history, Thomas offers wise insights, based on many new sources, achieving what might have seemed impossible: He has rendered a new Nixon. Michael Beschloss, author of \"Presidential Courage: Brave Leaders and How They Changed America 1789 1989\" Richard Nixon is one of the most complex and fascinating characters in American history. In this poignant, revealing, and compellingly readable book, Evan Thomas makes him human. Jay Winik, author of \"April 1865 and The Great Upheaval\" What was it really like to be Richard Nixon? Evan Thomas tackles this fascinating question by peeling back the layers of a man driven by a poignant mix of optimism and fear. The result is both insightful history and an astonishingly compelling psychological portrait of an anxious introvert who struggled to be a transformative statesman.

Americans have built an empire on the idea of \"race,\" a falsehood that damages us all but falls most heavily on the bodies of black women and men--bodies exploited through slavery and segregation, and, today, threatened, locked up, and murdered out of all proportion. What is it like to inhabit a black body and find a way to live within it? And how can we all honestly reckon with this fraught history and free ourselves from its burden? Between the World and Me is Ta-Nehisi Coates's attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son. Coates shares with his son--and readers--the story of his awakening to the truth about his place in the world through a series of revelatory experiences, from Howard University to Civil War battlefields, from the South Side of Chicago to Paris, from his childhood home to the living rooms of mothers whose children's lives were taken as American plunder. Beautifully woven from personal narrative, reimagined history, and fresh, emotionally charged reportage, Between the World and Me clearly illuminates the past, bracingly confronts our present, and offers a transcendent vision for a way forward. Praise for Between the World and Me \"Powerful and passionate . . . profoundly moving . . . a searing meditation on what it means to be black in America today.\"--Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times \"Brilliant . . . [Coates] is firing on all cylinders, and it is something to behold: a mature writer entirely consumed by a momentous subject and working at the extreme of his considerable powers at the very moment national events most conform to his vision.\"--The Washington Post \"I've been wondering who might fill the intellectual void that plagued me after James Baldwin died. Clearly it is Ta-Nehisi Coates. The language of Between the World and Me, like Coates's journey, is visceral, eloquent, and beautifully redemptive. And its examination of the hazards and hopes of black male life is as profound as it is revelatory.\"--Toni Morrison \"A brilliant thinker at the top of his powers, Coates has distilled four hundred years of history and his own anguish and wisdom into a prayer for his beloved son and an invocation to the conscience of his country. An instant classic and a gift to us all.\"--Isabel Wilkerson, author of The Warmth of Other Suns \"I know that this book is addressed to the author's son, and by obvious analogy to all boys and young men of color as they pass, inexorably, into harm's way. I hope that I will be forgiven, then, for feeling that Coates was speaking to me, too, one father to another, teaching me that real courage is the courage to be vulnerable.\"--Michael Chabon \"A work of rare beauty . . . a love letter written in a moral emergency, one that Coates exposes with the precision of an autopsy and the force of an exorcism.\"--Slate", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780812993547"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0812993543"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 152, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 4.5, "ratingsCount": 2544, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.0.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YoGJDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YoGJDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=YoGJDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:0812993543&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=YoGJDQAAQBAJ&dq=isbn:0812993543&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Between_the_World_and_Me.html?hl=&id=YoGJDQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=YoGJDQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER * LONGLISTED FOR THE NATIONAL BOOK AWARD * Hailed by Toni Morrison as &quot;required reading,&quot; a bold and personal literary exploration of America&#39;s racial history by &quot;the single best writer on the subject of race in ..."}}]}

Surfing only looks like a sport. To initiates, it is something else entirely: a beautiful addiction, a demanding course of study, a morally dangerous pastime, a way of life. Raised in California and Hawaii, Finnegan started surfing as a child. He has chased waves all over the world, wandering for years through the South Pacific, Australia, Asia, Africa. A bookish boy, and then an excessively adventurous young man, he went on to become a distinguished writer and war reporter. Barbarian Days takes us deep into unfamiliar worlds, some of them right under our noses\u2014off the coasts of New York and San Francisco. It immerses the reader in the edgy camaraderie of close male friendships annealed in challenging waves. Finnegan shares stories of life in a whitesonly gang in a tough school in Honolulu even while his closest friend was a Hawaiian surfer. He shows us a world turned upside down for kids and adults alike by the social upheavals of the 1960s. He details the intricacies of famous waves and his own apprenticeships to them. Youthful folly\u2014he drops LSD while riding huge Honolua Bay, on Maui\u2014is served up with rueful humor. He and a buddy, their knapsacks crammed with reef charts, bushwhack through Polynesia. They discover, while camping on an uninhabited island in Fiji, one of the world\u2019s greatest waves. As Finnegan\u2019s travels take him ever farther afield, he becomes an improbable anthropologist: unpicking the picturesque simplicity of a Samoan fishing village, dissecting the sexual politics of Tongan interactions with Americans and Japanese, navigating the Indonesian black market while nearly succumbing to malaria. Throughout, he surfs, carrying readers with him on rides of harrowing, unprecedented lucidity. Barbarian Days is an old-school adventure story, an intellectual autobiography, a social history, a literary road movie, and an extraordinary exploration of the gradual mastering of an exacting, little understood art. Today, Finnegan\u2019s surfing life is undiminished. Frantically juggling work and family, he chases his enchantment through Long Island ice storms and obscure corners of Madagascar.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1594203474"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781594203473"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 464, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MQffngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MQffngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=MQffngEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1594203474&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=MQffngEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1594203474&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Barbarian_Days.html?hl=&id=MQffngEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=MQffngEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "A deeply rendered self-portrait of a lifelong surfer by the acclaimed New Yorker writer Barbarian Days is William Finnegan\u2019s memoir of an obsession, a complex enchantment."}}]}

What is autism? A lifelong disability, or a naturally occurring form of cognitive difference akin to certain forms of genius? In truth, it is all of these things and more--and the future of our society depends on our understanding it. WIRED reporter Steve Silberman unearths the secret history of autism, long suppressed by the same clinicians who became famous for discovering it, and finds surprising answers to the crucial question of why the number of diagnoses has soared in recent years. Going back to the earliest days of autism research and chronicling the brave and lonely journey of autistic people and their families through the decades, Silberman provides long-sought solutions to the autism puzzle, while mapping out a path for our society toward a more humane world in which people with learning differences and those who love them have access to the resources they need to live happier, healthier, more secure, and more meaningful lives. Along the way, he reveals the untold story of Hans Asperger, the father of Asperger's syndrome, whose \"little professors\" were targeted by the darkest social-engineering experiment in human history; exposes the covert campaign by child psychiatrist Leo Kanner to suppress knowledge of the autism spectrum for fifty years; and casts light on the growing movement of \"neurodiversity\" activists seeking respect, support, technological innovation, accommodations in the workplace and in education, and the right to self-determination for those with cognitive differences.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781583334676"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "158333467X"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 534, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Psychology"], "averageRating": 4.5, "ratingsCount": 20, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.2.0.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3WgBDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3WgBDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=3WgBDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:158333467X&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=3WgBDAAAQBAJ&dq=isbn:158333467X&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Neurotribes.html?hl=&id=3WgBDAAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=3WgBDAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Along the way, he reveals the untold story of Hans Asperger, the father of Asperger&#39;s syndrome, whose &quot;little professors&quot; were targeted by the darkest social-engineering experiment in human history; exposes the covert campaign by child ..."}}]}

Instead, it saved those democracies-but with a fateful cost. 1944 witnessed a series of titanic events: FDR at the pinnacle of his wartime leadership as well as his re-election, the planning of Operation Overlord with Churchill and Stalin, the unprecedented D-Day invasion, the liberation of Paris and the horrific Battle of the Bulge, and the tumultuous conferences that finally shaped the coming peace. But on the way, millions of more lives were still at stake as President Roosevelt was exposed to mounting evidence of the most grotesque crime in history, the Final Solution. Just as the Allies were landing in Normandy, the Nazis were accelerating the killing of millions of European Jews. Winik shows how escalating pressures fell on an all but dying Roosevelt, whose rapidly deteriorating health was a closely guarded secret. Here then, as with D-Day, was a momentous decision for the president. Was winning the war the best way to rescue the Jews? Was a rescue even possible? Or would it get in the way of defeating Hitler? In a year when even the most audacious undertakings were within the world's reach, including the liberation of Europe, one challenge-saving Europe's Jews-seemed to remain beyond Roosevelt's grasp. Winik provides a stunningly fresh look at the twentieth century's most pivotal year. 1944: FDR and the Year that Changed Historyis the first book to tell these events with such moral clarity and unprecedented sweep, and a moving appreciation of the extraordinary struggles of the era's outsized figures.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781439114087"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1439114080"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 656, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 4.0, "ratingsCount": 2, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.3.0.0.preview.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N8uNCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N8uNCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=N8uNCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:1439114080&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=N8uNCgAAQBAJ&dq=isbn:1439114080&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/1944.html?hl=&id=N8uNCgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=N8uNCgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "&quot;Chronicles the events of 1944 to reveal how nearly the Allies lost World War II, citing the pivotal contributions of FDR, Churchill, and Stalin,&quot;--Novelist."}}]}

Reich"], "publisher": "Knopf", "publishedDate": "2015", "description": "From the author of Aftershock and The Work of Nations, his most important book to date--a passionate yet practical, sweeping yet minutely argued, myth-shattering breakdown of what's wrong with our political-economic system, and what it will take to fix it. Perhaps no one is better acquainted with the intersection of finance and politics than Robert B. Reich, and now he reveals the cycles of power and influence that have perpetuated a new American oligarchy, a shrinking middle class, and the greatest income inequality and wealth disparity in eighty years. He makes clear how centrally problematic our veneration of the \"free market\" is, and how it has masked the power of the moneyed interests to tilt the market to their benefit.

Now, for the first time, in his tenth travel book, Theroux explores a piece of America -- the Deep South. He finds there a paradoxical place, full of incomparable music, unparalleled cuisine, and yet also some of the nation's worst schools, housing, and unemployment rates. It's these parts of the South, so often ignored, that have caught Theroux's keen traveler's eye. On road trips spanning four seasons, wending along rural highways, Theroux visits gun shows and small-town churches, laborers in Arkansas, and parts of Mississippi where they still call the farm up the road \"the plantation.\" He talks to mayors and social workers, writers and reverends, the working poor and farming families -- the unsung heroes of the south, the people who, despite it all, never left, and also those who returned home to rebuild a place they could never live without.

M Train is a journey through eighteen \"stations.\" It begins in the tiny Greenwich Village caf\u00e9 where Smith goes every morning for black coffee, ruminates on the world as it is and the world as it was, and writes in her notebook. We then travel, through prose that shifts fluidly between dreams and reality, past and present, across a landscape of creative aspirations and inspirations: from Frida Kahlo's Casa Azul in Mexico, to a meeting of an Arctic explorer's society in Berlin; from the ramshackle seaside bungalow in New York's Far Rockaway that Smith buys just before Hurricane Sandy hits, to the graves of Genet, Plath, Rimbaud, and Mishima. Woven throughout are reflections on the writer's craft and on artistic creation, alongside signature memories including her life in Michigan with her husband, guitarist Fred Sonic Smith, whose untimely death was an irremediable loss. For it is loss, as well as the consolation we might salvage from it, that lies at the heart of this exquisitely told memoir, one augmented by stunning black-and-white Polaroids taken by Smith herself.

From the first cities in Mesopotamia to the growth of Greece and Rome to the depredations by the Mongols and the Black Death to the Great Game and the fall of Communism, the fate of the West has always been inextricably linked to the East.

In 2009, the award-winning journalist Rebecca Traister started All the Single Ladies\u2014a book she thought would be a work of contemporary journalism\u2014about the twenty-first century phenomenon of the American single woman. It was the year the proportion of American women who were married dropped below fifty percent; and the median age of first marriages, which had remained between twenty and twenty-two years old for nearly a century (1890\u20131980), had risen dramatically to twenty-seven. But over the course of her vast research and more than a hundred interviews with academics and social scientists and prominent single women, Traister discovered a startling truth: the phenomenon of the single woman in America is not a new one. And historically, when women were given options beyond early heterosexual marriage, the results were massive social change\u2014temperance, abolition, secondary education, and more. Today, only twenty percent of Americans are wed by age twenty-nine, compared to nearly sixty percent in 1960. The Population Reference Bureau calls it a \u201cdramatic reversal.\u201d All the Single Ladies is a remarkable portrait of contemporary American life and how we got here, through the lens of the single American woman. Covering class, race, sexual orientation, and filled with vivid anecdotes from fascinating contemporary and historical figures, All the Single Ladies is destined to be a classic work of social history and journalism. Exhaustively researched, brilliantly balanced, and told with Traister\u2019s signature wit and insight, this book should be shelved alongside Gail Collins\u2019s When Everything Changed.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1476716560"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781476716565"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 352, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "averageRating": 4.0, "ratingsCount": 10, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yb7JsgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yb7JsgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=yb7JsgEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1476716560&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=yb7JsgEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1476716560&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/All_the_Single_Ladies.html?hl=&id=yb7JsgEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=yb7JsgEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "In 2009, award-winning journalist Rebecca Traister started All the Single Ladies about the twenty-first century phenomenon of the American single woman."}}]}
