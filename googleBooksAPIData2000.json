But Kate\u2019s stress over leaving work quickly turns to panic when she arrives at the school and finds it surrounded by police officers, fire trucks, and an ambulance. By then it\u2019s already too late for Amelia. And for Kate. An academic overachiever despondent over getting caught cheating has jumped to her death.

Until she gets an anonymous text: She didn\u2019t jump. Reconstructing Amelia is about secret first loves, old friendships, and an all-girls club steeped in tradition. But, most of all, it\u2019s the story of how far a mother will go to vindicate the memory of a daughter whose life she couldn\u2019t save.

Magician's End Thirty years ago, Raymond E. Feist wrote his first novel, Magician, a story about an orphan boy named Pug who is thrust by a war into captivity in an alien world, only to rise from slavery to become a Master Magician. Magician introduced readers to Midkemia and the Riftwars, an epic series of battles between Good and Evil that have scarred this remarkable realm for generations. Now, after twenty-nine books (authored and coauthored), Feist delivers the crowning achievement of his renowned bestselling career: Magician's End, the final chapter of the Chaoswar Saga and the climax of his extraordinary Riftwar Cycle. An uneasy quiet has settled upon Midkemia in the wake of a surprise invasion. But the land is far from peaceful. Leaderless, the Kingdom is on the brink of anarchy and civil war, unless Hal conDoin, Duke of Crydee, and his brothers can rally their allies to crown a new king. They must move quickly, for war has left the land vulnerable to an agency of horrific destruction not of this world. No one is safe, not even the Star Elves whose city deep in the Grey Tower Mountains has come under attack by an ancient darkness that seeks to extinguish every living thing in Midkemia. Yet the bravery of determined warriors\u2014brothers in blood and arms\u2014is not enough to ensure the Kingdom's preservation without the magic of the Master Sorcerer Pug. A powerful spell has trapped him, his son Magnus, and two unlikely allies in an unfamiliar realm, and they must find their separate ways home\u2014a journey of memory and discovery that will illuminate the truth of the destiny that awaits them. But to save Midkemia\u2014and everything he has fought for and all he cherishes\u2014Pug will have to pay the ultimate price. A breathtaking tale of elves and men, love and hate, ambition and sacrifice, intrigue and brotherhood, war and peace, Magician's End brilliantly captures the essence of life and the eternal struggle for survival. It is an extraordinary ending to the magnificent saga that has made award-winning Raymond E.

The first male child born in the newly established Republic of Texas, Eli McCullough is thirteen years old when a marauding band of Comanches storms his homestead and brutally murders his mother and sister, taking him captive. Brave and clever, Eli quickly adapts to life among the Comanches, learning their ways and language, answering to a new name, becoming the chief's adopted son, and waging war against their enemies, including white men\u2014which complicates his sense of loyalty and understanding of who he is. But when disease, starvation, and overwhelming numbers of armed Americans decimate the tribe, Eli finds himself alone. Neither white nor Indian, civilized nor fully wild, he must carve a place for himself in a world in which he does not fully belong\u2014a journey of adventure, tragedy, hardship, grit, and luck that reverberates in the lives of his progeny. Intertwined with Eli's story are those of his son, Peter, a man who bears the emotional cost of his father's drive for power, and Jeannie, Eli's great-granddaughter, a woman who must fight hardened rivals to succeed in a man's world. Philipp Meyer deftly explores how Eli's ruthlessness and steely pragmatism transform subsequent generations of McCulloughs. Love, honor, even children are sacrificed in the name of ambition as the family becomes one of the richest powers in Texas, a ranching-and-oil dynasty of unsurpassed wealth and privilege. Yet, like all empires, the McCulloughs must eventually face the consequences of their choices.

At ninety-one years old, in poor health and alone in the world, he finds himself stranded on an isolated embankment after a car crash. Suffering multiple injuries, he struggles to retain consciousness until a blurry image materializes and comes into focus beside him: his beloved wife Ruth, who passed away nine years ago. Urging him to hang on, she forces him to remain alert by recounting the stories of their lifetime together - how they met, the precious paintings they collected together, the dark days of WWII and its effect on them and their families. Ira knows that Ruth can't possibly be in the car with him, but he clings to her words and his memories, reliving the sorrows and everyday joys that defined their marriage. A few miles away, at a local bull-riding event, a Wake Forest College senior's life is about to change. Recovering from a recent break-up, Sophia Danko meets a young cowboy named Luke, who bears little resemblance to the privileged frat boys she has encountered at school. Through Luke, Sophia is introduced to a world in which the stakes of survival and success, ruin and reward -- even life and death - loom large in everyday life. As she and Luke fall in love, Sophia finds herself imagining a future far removed from her plans -- a future that Luke has the power to rewrite . . . if the secret he's keeping doesn't destroy it first. Ira and Ruth. Sophia and Luke. Two couples who have little in common, and who are separated by years and experience.

But the impending wedding provokes some very mixed reactions and opens a Pandora's box of toxic secrets\u2014dark and painful truths that have festered below the surface of the Ohs' lives.

Violet Minturn is the privileged daughter of the American madam of the city's most exclusive courtesan house. But when the Ching dynasty is overturned, Violet is separated from her mother in a cruel act of chicanery and forced to become a \"virgin courtesan.\" Half-Chinese and half-American, Violet grapples with her place in the worlds of East and West\u2014until she is able to merge her two halves, empowering her to become a shrewd courtesan who excels in the business of seduction and illusion, though she still struggles to understand who she is. Back in 1897 San Francisco, Violet's mother, Lucia, chooses a disastrous course as a sixteen-year-old, when her infatuation with a Chinese painter compels her to leave her home for Shanghai. Shocked by her lover's adherence to Chinese traditions, she is unable to change him, despite her unending American ingenuity. Fueled by betrayals, both women refuse to submit to fate and societal expectations, persisting in their quests to recover what was taken from them: respect; a secure future; and, most poignantly, love from their parents, lovers, and children. To reclaim their lives, they take separate journeys\u2014to a backwater hamlet in China, the wealthy environs of the Hudson River Valley, and, ultimately, the unknown areas of their hearts, where they discover what remains after their many failings to love and be loved. Spanning more than forty years and two continents, The Valley of Amazement transports readers from the collapse of China's last imperial dynasty to the beginning of the Republic and recaptures the lost world of old Shanghai through the inner workings of courtesan houses and the lives of the foreigners living in the International Settlement, both erased by World War II. A deeply evocative narrative of the profound connections between mothers and daughters, imbued with Tan's characteristic insight and humor, The Valley of Amazement conjures a story of inherited trauma, desire and deception, and the power and obstinacy of love.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0062107313"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780062107312"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 608, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "averageRating": 3.0, "ratingsCount": 54, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kKK1lwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kKK1lwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=kKK1lwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0062107313&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=kKK1lwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0062107313&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Valley_of_Amazement.html?hl=&id=kKK1lwEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=kKK1lwEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Spanning more than forty years and two continents, The Valley of Amazement transports readers from the collapse of China&#39;s last imperial dynasty to the beginning of the Republic and recaptures the lost world of old Shanghai through the ..."}}]}

The body of a young woman has been discovered on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's rugby field. The victim, a graduate student named Gail Shipman, is oddly draped in ivory linen and posed in a way that is too deliberate to be the killer's first strike. A preliminary examination in the sea of red mud where the body has been left also reveals a bizarre residue that fluoresces blood red, emerald green and sapphire blue. Physical evidence links the case to a series of uniquely weird homicides in Washington, D.C., where Scarpetta's FBI husband has been deployed to help capture a serial killer dubbed the Capital Murderer. The cases all connect and yet seem to conflict. Gail Shipman was murdered for financial gain?or was she?

When Mickey learns that the victim was his own former client, a prostitute he thought he had rescued and put on the straight and narrow path, he knows he is on the hook for this one. He soon finds out that she was back in LA and back in the life. Far from saving her, Mickey may have been the one who put her in danger. Haunted by the ghosts of his past, Mickey must work tirelessly and bring all his skill to bear on a case that could mean his ultimate redemption or proof of his ultimate guilt.

Now the conspiracy stands exposed by spies Anton Zilwicki and Victor Cachat\u2014one an agent of Honor Harrington\u2019s Star Kingdom of Manticore, the other a Havenite operative.

Dr. Emory Charbonneau, a pediatrician and marathon runner, disappears on a mountain road in North Carolina. By the time her husband Jeff, miffed over a recent argument, reports her missing, the trail has grown cold. Literally. Fog and ice encapsulate the mountainous wilderness and paralyze the search for her. While police suspect Jeff of \"instant divorce,\" Emory, suffering from an unexplained head injury, regains consciousness and finds herself the captive of a man whose violent past is so dark that he won't even tell her his name. She's determined to escape him, and willing to take any risks necessary to survive. Unexpectedly, however, the two have a dangerous encounter with people who adhere to a code of justice all their own. At the center of the dispute is a desperate young woman whom Emory can't turn her back on, even if it means breaking the law. Wrong becomes right at the hands of the man who strikes fear, but also sparks passion. As her husband's deception is revealed, and the FBI closes in on her captor, Emory begins to wonder if the man with no name is, in fact, her rescuer from those who wish her dead - and from heartbreak.

In the LAPD's Open-Unsolved Unit, not many murder victims die a decade after the crime. So when a man succumbs to complications from being shot by a stray bullet ten years earlier, Bosch catches a case in which the body is still fresh, but any other clues are virtually nonexistent. Even a veteran cop would find this one tough going, but Bosch's new partner, Detective Lucia Soto, has no homicide experience. A young star in the department, Soto has been assigned to Bosch so that he can pass on to her his hard-won expertise. Now Bosch and Soto are tasked with solving a murder that turns out to be highly charged and politically sensitive. Beginning with the bullet that has been lodged for years in the victim's spine, they must pull new leads from years-old evidence, and these soon reveal that the shooting was anything but random. As their investigation picks up speed, it leads to another unsolved case with even greater stakes: the deaths of several children in a fire that occurred twenty years ago. But when their work starts to threaten careers and lives, Bosch and Soto must decide whether it is worth risking everything to find the truth, or if it's safer to let some secrets stay buried.

In his blockbuster thrillers Zero Day and The Forgotten, he enthralled readers with John Puller. A combat veteran and special agent with the U.S. Army, Puller is the man they call to investigate the toughest crimes facing the nation. But all his training, all his experience, all his skills will not prepare him for his newest case, one that will force him to hunt down the most formidable and brilliant prey he has ever tracked: his own brother. THE ESCAPE It's a prison unlike any other. Military discipline rules. Its security systems are unmatched. None of its prisoners dream of escaping. They know it's impossible . . . until now. John Puller's older brother, Robert, was convicted of treason and national security crimes. His inexplicable escape from prison makes him the most wanted criminal in the country. Some in the government believe that John Puller represents their best chance at capturing Robert alive, and so Puller must bring in his brother to face justice. But Puller quickly discovers that his brother is pursued by others who don't want him to survive. Puller is in turn pushed into an uneasy, fraught partnership with another agent, who may have an agenda of her own. They dig more deeply into the case together, and Puller finds that not only are her allegiances unclear, but there are troubling details about his brother's conviction . . . and someone out there doesn't want the truth to ever come to light.

Now he introduces a startling, original new character: a man with perfect memory who must solve his own family's murder. MEMORY MAN Amos Decker's life changed forever--twice. The first time was on the gridiron. A big, towering athlete, he was the only person from his hometown of Burlington ever to go pro. But his career ended before it had a chance to begin. On his very first play, a violent helmet-to-helmet collision knocked him off the field for good, and left him with an improbable side effect--he can never forget anything. The second time was at home nearly two decades later. Now a police detective, Decker returned from a stakeout one evening and entered a nightmare--his wife, young daughter, and brother-in-law had been murdered.His family destroyed, their killer's identity as mysterious as the motive behind the crime, and unable to forget a single detail from that horrible night, Decker finds his world collapsing around him. He leaves the police force, loses his home, and winds up on the street, taking piecemeal jobs as a private investigator when he can. But over a year later, a man turns himself in to the police and confesses to the murders. At the same time a horrific event nearly brings Burlington to its knees, and Decker is called back in to help with this investigation. Decker also seizes his chance to learn what really happened to his family that night. To uncover the stunning truth, he must use his remarkable gifts and confront the burdens that go along with them. He must endure the memories he would much rather forget. And he may have to make the ultimate sacrifice.

Brought to Kenya from England as a child and then abandoned by her mother, Beryl is raised by both her father and the native Kipsigis tribe who share his estate. Her unconventional upbringing transforms Beryl into a bold young woman with a fierce love of all things wild and an inherent understanding of nature's delicate balance. But even the wild child must grow up, and when everything Beryl knows and trusts dissolves, she is catapulted into a string of disastrous relationships. Beryl forges her own path as a horse trainer, and her uncommon style attracts the eye of the Happy Valley set, a decadent, bohemian community of European expats who also live and love by their own set of rules. But it's the ruggedly charismatic Denys Finch Hatton who ultimately helps Beryl navigate the uncharted territory of her own heart. The intensity of their love reveals Beryl's truest self and her fate: to fly.

With a degree from Duke Law School and a job at a prestigious firm in Wilmington, she is a dark-haired beauty with a seemingly flawless professional track record.

When Alice toppled down the rabbit-hole 150 years ago, she found a Wonderland as rife with inconsistent rules and abrasive egos as the world she left behind. But what of that world? How did 1860s Oxford react to Alice\u2019s disappearance? In this brilliant work of fiction, Gregory Maguire turns his dazzling imagination to the question of underworlds, undergrounds, underpinnings\u2014and understandings old and new, offering an inventive spin on Carroll\u2019s enduring tale.

Ada brings to Wonderland her own imperfect apprehension of cause and effect as she embarks on an odyssey to find Alice and see her safely home from this surreal world below the world.

Of all the glamorous stars of New York high society, none blazes brighter than Babe Paley. Her flawless face regularly graces the pages of Vogue, and she is celebrated and adored for her ineffable style and exquisite taste, especially among her friends--the alluring socialite Swans Slim Keith, C. Z. Guest, Gloria Guinness, and Pamela Churchill. By all appearances, Babe has it all: money, beauty, glamour, jewels, influential friends, a prestigious husband, and gorgeous homes. But beneath this elegantly composed exterior dwells a passionate woman--a woman desperately longing for true love and connection. Enter Truman Capote. This diminutive golden-haired genius with a larger-than-life personality explodes onto the scene, setting Babe and her circle of Swans aflutter. Through Babe, Truman gains an unlikely entr\u00e9e into the enviable lives of Manhattan's elite, along with unparalleled access to the scandal and gossip of Babe's powerful circle. Sure of the loyalty of the man she calls \"True Heart,\" Babe never imagines the destruction Truman will leave in his wake. But once a storyteller, always a storyteller--even when the stories aren't his to tell. Truman's fame is at its peak when such notable celebrities as Frank and Mia Sinatra, Lauren Bacall, and Rose Kennedy converge on his glittering Black and White Ball. But all too soon, he'll ignite a literary scandal whose repercussions echo through the years. The Swans of Fifth Avenue will seduce and startle readers as it opens the door onto one of America's most sumptuous eras.

Gossipy and fun, it's also a nuanced look at the beauty and cruelty of a rarefied, bygone world.\"--People (Book of the Week) \"The strange and fascinating relationship between Truman Capote and his 'swans' is wonderfully reimagined in this engrossing novel.

Sometimes brotherhood can be another word for conspiracy. . . . Dennis Mira just had two unpleasant surprises. First he learned that his cousin Edward was secretly meeting with a real estate agent about their late grandfather's magnificent West Village brownstone, despite the promise they both made to keep it in the family. Then, when he went to the house to confront Edward about it, he got a blunt object to the back of the head. Luckily Dennis is married to Charlotte Mira, the NYPSD's top profiler and a good friend of Lieutenant Eve Dallas. When the two arrive on the scene, he explains that the last thing he saw was Edward in a chair, bruised and bloody. When he came to, his cousin was gone. With the mess cleaned up and the security disks removed, there's nothing left behind but a few traces for forensics to analyze. As a former lawyer, judge, and senator, Edward Mira mingled with the elite and crossed paths with criminals, making enemies on a regular basis. Like so many politicians, he also made some very close friends behind closed--and locked--doors. But a badge and a billionaire husband can get you into places others can't go, and Eve intends to shine some light on the dirty deals and dark motives behind the disappearance of a powerful man, the family discord over a multimillion-dollar piece of real estate . . . and a new case that no one saw coming.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780399170898"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0399170898"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 388, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "averageRating": 4.0, "ratingsCount": 12, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Go3ZCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Go3ZCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=Go3ZCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:0399170898&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=Go3ZCwAAQBAJ&dq=isbn:0399170898&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Brotherhood_in_Death.html?hl=&id=Go3ZCwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Go3ZCwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The new novel featuring homicide detective Eve Dallas from the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Devoted in Death."}}]}

Kennedy's closest advisor recounts in full for the first time his experience counseling Kennedy through the most dramatic moments in American history. Sorensen returns to January 1953, when he and the freshman senator from Massachusetts began their extraordinary professional and personal relationship. Rising from legislative assistant to speechwriter and advisor, the young lawyer from Nebraska worked closely with JFK on his most important speeches, as well as his book Profiles in Courage. Sorensen encouraged the junior senator's political ambitions\u2014from a failed bid for the vice presidential nomination in 1956 to the successful presidential campaign in 1960, after which he was named Special Counsel to the President. Sorensen describes in thrilling detail his experience advising JFK during some of the most crucial days of his presidency, from the decision to go to the moon to the Cuban Missile Crisis, when JFK requested that the thirty-four-year-old Sorensen draft the key letter to Khrushchev at the most critical point of the world's first nuclear confrontation. After Kennedy was assassinated, Sorensen stayed with President Johnson for a few months before leaving to write a biography of JFK. In 1968 he returned to Washington to help run Robert Kennedy's presidential campaign. Through it all, Sorensen never lost sight of the ideals that brought him to Washington and to the White House, working tirelessly to promote and defend free, peaceful societies.

Levitt", "Stephen J. Dubner"], "publisher": "Harper Collins", "publishedDate": "2006-10-17", "description": "Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? How did the legalization of abortion affect the rate of violent crime? These may not sound like typical questions for an econo-mist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much-heralded scholar who studies the riddles of everyday life\u2014from cheating and crime to sports and child-rearing\u2014and whose conclusions turn conventional wisdom on its head. Freakonomics is a groundbreaking collaboration between Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner, an award-winning author and journalist. They usually begin with a mountain of data and a simple question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics. Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives\u2014how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. In Freakonomics, they explore the hidden side of . . . well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Klu Klux Klan. What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a great deal of complexity and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and\u2014if the right questions are asked\u2014is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking. Freakonomics establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work, then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But Freakonomics can provide more than that.

In Havana Nocturne, T. J. English offers a riveting, multifaceted true tale of organized crime, political corruption, roaring nightlife, revolution, and international conflict that interweaves the dual stories of the Mob in Havana and the event that would overshadow it, the Cuban Revolution. As the Cuban people labored under a violently repressive regime throughout the 1950s, Mob leaders Meyer Lansky and Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano turned their eye to Havana. To them, Cuba was the ultimate dream, the greatest hope for the future of the American Mob in the post-Prohibition years of intensified government crackdowns. But when it came time to make their move, it was Lansky, the brilliant Jewish mobster, who reigned supreme. Having cultivated strong ties with the Cuban government and in particular the brutal dictator Fulgencio Batista, Lansky brought key mobsters to Havana to put his ambitious business plans in motion. Before long, the Mob, with Batista's corrupt government in its pocket, owned the biggest luxury hotels and casinos in Havana, launching an unprecedented tourism boom complete with the most lavish entertainment, the world's biggest celebrities, the most beautiful women, and gambling galore. But their dreams collided with those of Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, and others who would lead the country's disenfranchised to overthrow their corrupt government and its foreign partners\u2014an epic cultural battle that English captures in all its sexy, decadent, ugly glory. Bringing together long-buried historical information with English's own research in Havana\u2014including interviews with the era's key survivors\u2014Havana Nocturne takes readers back to Cuba in the years when it was a veritable devil's playground for mob leaders. English deftly weaves together the parallel stories of the Havana Mob\u2014featuring notorious criminals such as Santo Trafficante Jr. and Albert Anastasia\u2014and Castro's 26th of July Movement in a riveting, up-close look at how the Mob nearly attained its biggest dream in Havana\u2014and how Fidel Castro trumped it all with the Cuban Revolution.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780061147715"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0061147710"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 416, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["True Crime"], "averageRating": 4.0, "ratingsCount": 12, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ymIIgUtHrBMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ymIIgUtHrBMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=ymIIgUtHrBMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:0061147710&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=ymIIgUtHrBMC&dq=isbn:0061147710&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Havana_Nocturne.html?hl=&id=ymIIgUtHrBMC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ymIIgUtHrBMC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "In Havana Nocturne, T.

No cloistered don, this tall, married Englishman was a freethinking intellectual, who practiced nudism and was devoted to a quirky brand of folk dancing. In 1937, while working as a biochemist at Cambridge University, he instantly fell in love with a visiting Chinese student, with whom he began a lifelong affair. He soon became fascinated with China, and his mistress swiftly persuaded the ever-enthusiastic Needham to travel to her home country, where he embarked on a series of extraordinary expeditions to the farthest frontiers of this ancient empire. He searched everywhere for evidence to bolster his conviction that the Chinese were responsible for hundreds of mankind's most familiar innovations\u2014including printing, the compass, explosives, suspension bridges, even toilet paper\u2014often centuries before the rest of the world. His thrilling and dangerous journeys, vividly recreated by Winchester, took him across war-torn China to far-flung outposts, consolidating his deep admiration for the Chinese people. After the war, Needham was determined to tell the world what he had discovered, and began writing his majestic Science and Civilisation in China, describing the country's long and astonishing history of invention and technology. By the time he died, he had produced, essentially single-handedly, seventeen immense volumes, marking him as the greatest one-man encyclopedist ever.

From the White House to Downing Street, from the fault-line countries of South Asia to the sands of Guant\u00e1namo, Suskind offers an astonishing story that connects world leaders to the forces waging today's shadow wars and to the next generation of global citizens. Tracking down truth and hope within the Beltway and far beyond it, Suskind delivers historic disclosures with this emotionally stirring and strikingly original portrait of the post-9/11 world. In a sweeping, propulsive, and multilayered narrative, The Way of the World investigates how America relinquished the moral leadership it now desperately needs to fight the real threat of our era: a nuclear weapon in the hands of terrorists. Truth, justice, and accountability become more than mere words in this story. Suskind shows where the most neglected dangers lie in the story of \"The Armageddon Test\" \u2014a desperate gamble to send undercover teams into the world's nuclear black market to frustrate the efforts of terrorists trying to procure weapons-grade uranium. In the end, he finally reveals for the first time the explosive falsehood underlying the Iraq War and the entire Bush presidency. While the public and political realms struggle, The Way of the World simultaneously follows an ensemble of characters in America and abroad who are turning fear and frustration into a desperate\u2014and often daring\u2014brand of human salvation. They include a striving, twenty-four-year-old Pakistani \u00e9migr\u00e9, a fearless UN refugee commissioner, an Afghan teenager, a Holocaust survivor's son, and Benazir Bhutto, who discovers, days before her death, how she's been abandoned by the United States at her moment of greatest need. They are all testing American values at a time of peril, and discovering solutions\u2014human solutions\u2014to so much that has gone wrong. For anyone hoping to exercise truly informed consent and begin the process of restoring the values and hope\u2014along with the moral clarity and earned optimism\u2014at the heart of the American tradition, The Way of the World is a must-read.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "OTHER", "identifier": "STANFORD:36105131665767"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 432, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "averageRating": 4.0, "ratingsCount": 6, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3QkVAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3QkVAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=3QkVAQAAIAAJ&dq=isbn:0061430625&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=3QkVAQAAIAAJ&dq=isbn:0061430625&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Way_of_the_World.html?hl=&id=3QkVAQAAIAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=3QkVAQAAIAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Truth, justice, and accountability become more than mere words in this story."}}]}

This beautifully designed photographic essay flows from Prince's sensational, unprecedented, record-breaking, sold-out 21 concerts in 21 Nights at London's 02 Arena in 2007. Giving insight into his dueling worlds of performance and solitude, 21 Nights incorporates Prince's evocative poetry and lyrics to new songs and other selections, and 124 full-color, sumptuous never-before-published images by Randee St. Nicholas. As part of the multi-dimensional experience, it will also include \"Indigo Night,\" a CD--available only with the book--capturing Prince's after-hours, live after-show sessions--rare and profound moments of musical genius. 21 Nights takes the reader from the passenger seat of a limousine zipping through the streets of London to his sleeping quarters in a luxury hotel. In between we see him and his phenomenal band of musicians, singers and dancers backstage in the make up room to onstage, bathed in purple lights and a fog of gray smoke. Like a movie-in-a-book, readers are taken on his journey from London to Prague, in a style that takes glam rock to a new level. Then there is poetry and lyrics that reveal the heart and soul of Prince--in addition to his incomparable talent. Going beyond the catchy hook, he expresses himself on everything from the destructive forces of war, greed and superficiality the life giving energy of love, beauty, and--of course--music.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1416554440"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781416554448"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 256, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Music"], "averageRating": 5.0, "ratingsCount": 3, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=x29PMwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=x29PMwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=x29PMwAACAAJ&dq=isbn:1416554440&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=x29PMwAACAAJ&dq=isbn:1416554440&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/21_Nights.html?hl=&id=x29PMwAACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=x29PMwAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "As part of the multi-dimensional experience, it will also include &quot;Indigo Night,&quot; a CD--available only with the book--capturing Prince&#39;s after-hours, live after-show sessions--rare and profound moments of musical genius. 21 Nights takes the ..."}}]}

What followed was a 4-year nightmare of drugs and alcohol, estrangement from friends and family, and his eventual suspension from baseball.

Josh Hamilton makes no excuses and places no blame on anyone other than himself.

His startling results shatter much of what we have long believed about what seduces our interest and drives us to buy.

Over the thirty years they had worked together, Alex and Irene had become famous\u2014two pioneers who opened an unprecedented window into the hidden yet vast world of animal minds. Alex's brain was the size of a shelled walnut, and when Irene and Alex first met, birds were not believed to possess any potential for language, consciousness, or anything remotely comparable to human intelligence. Yet, over the years, Alex proved many things. He could add. He could sound out words. He understood concepts like bigger, smaller, more, fewer, and none. He was capable of thought and intention. Together, Alex and Irene uncovered a startling reality: We live in a world populated by thinking, conscious creatures. The fame that resulted was extraordinary. Yet there was a side to their relationship that never made the papers. They were emotionally connected to one another. They shared a deep bond far beyond science. Alex missed Irene when she was away. He was jealous when she paid attention to other parrots, or even people. He liked to show her who was boss. He loved to dance. He sometimes became bored by the repetition of his tests, and played jokes on her. Sometimes they sniped at each other. Yet nearly every day, they each said, \"I love you.\" Alex and Irene stayed together through thick and thin\u2014despite sneers from experts, extraordinary financial sacrifices, and a nomadic existence from one univer\u00adsity to another.

Horse Soldiers is the dramatic account of a small band of Special Forces soldiers who secretly entered Afghanistan following 9/11 and rode to war on horses against the Taliban. Outnumbered forty to one, they pursued the enemy across mountainous terrain and, after a series of intense battles, captured the city of Mazar-i-Sharif, which was strategically essential if they were to defeat the Taliban. The bone-weary American soldiers were welcomed as liberators, and overjoyed Afghans thronged the streets. Then the action took a wholly unexpected turn. During a surrender of six hundred Taliban troops, the Horse Soldiers were ambushed. Dangerously outnumbered, they fought for their lives in the city's immense fortress, Qala-i-Janghi, or the House of War. At risk were the military gains of the entire campaign: if the soldiers perished or were captured, the effort to defeat the Taliban might be doomed. As the Americans struggled to hold the fortress, they faced some of the most intense urban warfare of our time. But until now the full story of the Horse Soldiers has never been told. Doug Stanton received unprecedented cooperation from the U.S. Army's Special Forces soldiers and Special Operations helicopter pilots, as well as access to voluminous after-battle reports. In addition, he interviewed more than one hundred participants and walked every inch of the climactic battleground. This exciting story is filled with unforgettable characters: brave Special Forces soldiers, tough CIA operatives, cunning Afghan warlords, anxious stateside soldiers' wives who do not know where their husbands have gone, and humble Afghan boys spying on the Taliban. Deeply researched and beautifully written, Stanton's account of America's quest to liberate an oppressed people touches the mythic. The Horse Soldiers combined ancient strategies of cavalry warfare with twenty-first-century aerial bombardment technology to perform a seemingly impossible feat.

These spirits have a great deal to say about what they have learned and discovered on the other side and how we, the living, can benefit from their experiences. Unfinished Business is filled with shocking and emotional stories of Van Praagh's communication with loved ones who cross over the barrier between the living and the dead to send messages to those whom they have left behind. Through these pro-found true stories, Van Praagh guides us on an adventure into the spirit world. The lessons for the living that he has learned from these experiences range from the dangers of emotional baggage caused by guilt, fear, and regret to the importance of karma, forgiveness, and taking responsibility for our actions. Van Praagh shares with us now the wisdom that, without him, we would only gain after death. Van Praagh writes: \"When people shed their physical bodies at death, their spiritual selves see life from a whole new perspective. It's as if they had Lasik surgery. They can finally take off their glasses and see everything more clearly. \"Spirits understand why certain situations had to happen. They are able to recognize the value of others, even their enemies, and what they had to learn from them. They also realize how they could have skipped certain mistakes by not letting their egos get in the way. After crossing into the light, spirits are ever eager to share their newfound knowledge with the living, and I am fortunate to be a beneficiary of spirits' wisdom and guidance, and I am happy to share their insights with you.\"", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780061778148"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0061778141"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 256, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Body, Mind & Spirit"], "averageRating": 4.0, "ratingsCount": 6, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UPJB_Umm_t4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UPJB_Umm_t4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=UPJB_Umm_t4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:0061778141&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=UPJB_Umm_t4C&dq=isbn:0061778141&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Unfinished_Business.html?hl=&id=UPJB_Umm_t4C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=UPJB_Umm_t4C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Unfinished Business is filled with shocking and emotional stories of Van Praagh&#39;s communication with loved ones who cross over the barrier between the living and the dead to send messages to those whom they have left behind."}}]}

Decline can be detected. Decline can be reversed. Amidst the desolate landscape of fallen great companies, Jim Collins began to wonder: How do the mighty fall? Can decline be detected early and avoided? How far can a company fall before the path toward doom becomes inevitable and unshakable? How can companies reverse course? In How the Mighty Fall, Collins confronts these questions, offering leaders the well-founded hope that they can learn how to stave off decline and, if they find themselves falling, reverse their course. Collins' research project\u2014more than four years in duration\u2014uncovered five step-wise stages of decline: Stage 1: Hubris Born of Success Stage 2: Undisciplined Pursuit of More Stage 3: Denial of Risk and Peril Stage 4: Grasping for Salvation Stage 5: Capitulation to Irrelevance or Death By understanding these stages of decline, leaders can substantially reduce their chances of falling all the way to the bottom. Great companies can stumble, badly, and recover. Every institution, no matter how great, is vulnerable to decline. There is no law of nature that the most powerful will inevitably remain at the top. Anyone can fall and most eventually do. But, as Collins' research emphasizes, some companies do indeed recover\u2014in some cases, coming back even stronger\u2014even after having crashed into the depths of Stage 4. Decline, it turns out, is largely self-inflicted, and the path to recovery lies largely within our own hands. We are not imprisoned by our circumstances, our history, or even our staggering defeats along the way. As long as we never get entirely knocked out of the game, hope always remains. The mighty can fall, but they can often rise again.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780977326419"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0977326411"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 240, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "averageRating": 4.0, "ratingsCount": 10, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5g53Bso1x_YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5g53Bso1x_YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=5g53Bso1x_YC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:0977326411&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=5g53Bso1x_YC&dq=isbn:0977326411&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/How_The_Mighty_Fall.html?hl=&id=5g53Bso1x_YC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=5g53Bso1x_YC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "How can companies reverse course?

Why do you make me do this? Because it's beautiful when it all comes together. I don't think it's ever beautiful. One day. Never. We'll see, my father said. Vamanos. From the age of three, Norman Ollestad was thrust into the world of surfing and competitive downhill skiing by the intense, charismatic father he both idolized and resented. While his friends were riding bikes, playing ball, and going to birthday parties, young Norman was whisked away in pursuit of wild and demanding adventures. Yet it were these exhilarating tests of skill that prepared \"Boy Wonder,\" as his father called him, to become a fearless champion\u2014and ultimately saved his life. Flying to a ski championship ceremony in February 1979, the chartered Cessna carrying Norman, his father, his father's girlfriend, and the pilot crashed into the San Gabriel Mountains and was suspended at 8,200 feet, engulfed in a blizzard. \"Dad and I were a team, and he was Superman,\" Ollestad writes. But now Norman's father was dead, and the devastated eleven-year-old had to descend the treacherous, icy mountain alone. Set amid the spontaneous, uninhibited surf culture of Malibu and Mexico in the late 1970s, this riveting memoir, written in crisp Hemingwayesque prose, recalls Ollestad's childhood and the magnetic man whose determination and love infuriated and inspired him\u2014and also taught him to overcome the indomitable. As it illuminates the complicated bond between an extraordinary father and his son, Ollestad's powerful and unforgettable true story offers remarkable insight for us all.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780061766725"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0061766720"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 288, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 27, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JvstjTdRN6cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JvstjTdRN6cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=JvstjTdRN6cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:0061766720&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=JvstjTdRN6cC&dq=isbn:0061766720&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Crazy_for_the_Storm.html?hl=&id=JvstjTdRN6cC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=JvstjTdRN6cC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "One day.

Crystal methamphetamine is widely considered to be the most dangerous drug in the world, and nowhere is that more true than in the small towns of the American heartland. Methland tells the story of Oelwein, Iowa (pop. 6,159), which, like thousands of other small towns across the country, has been left in the dust by the consolidation of the agricultural industry, a depressed local economy, and an out-migration of people. As if this weren\u2019t enough to deal with, an incredibly cheap, longlasting, and highly addictive drug has rolled into town. Over a period of four years, journalist Nick Reding brings us into the heart of Oelwein through a cast of intimately drawn characters, including: Clay Hallburg, the town doctor, who fights meth even as he struggles with his own alcoholism; Nathan Lein, the town prosecutor, whose caseload is filled almost exclusively with meth-related crime; and Jeff Rohrick, a meth addict, still trying to kick the habit after twenty years.

To live in Neverland. To be idolized-to be loved-by millions around the world. \"These seem completely unreasonable dreams. But from a boy from Gary, Indiana, who was special from the first, they became more than dreams. They became fundamental needs. And they were achieved during a lifetime that was stunning in its highs and lows, and that was, ultimately, far, far too short. \"Far too short and, more sadly still, perhaps poised for a triumphant next chapter. We will never know.\" While that is true-we will never know-we can revisit and celebrate that extraordinary life, and we do so in words and pictures in this special commemorative book. Although Michael Jackson lived just 50 years, he spent the great majority of that time in the public eye. We loved his as a boy, radiating joy and dancing up a storm in the Jackson 5, his falsetto tenor pouring forth from car radios coast to coast. We were subsequently thrilled by his reinvention as the biggest pop star on the planet, with \"Billie Jean\" and \"Beat It\" blasting from boom boxes around the world. The best pictures from each era are here. As you would expect, LIFE magazine, then the country's preeminent photo journal, was onto the Jackson 5 story early-in fact, we put the family on our cover when Michael was still a lad. He made the cover several more times, and he allowed LIFE exclusive access to his private California sanctum called Neverland. We have combed through our archives and found all the famous shots as well as several surprises, including never-before-seen pictures that show the boy and then the man in an unguarded, personal way. Also, we have taken the best from the portfolios of the world's top rock 'n' roll photographers and created, we think, a complete picture of this endlessly compelling entertainer. Michael Jackson was, like Sinatra, Elvis, the Beatles and few others, a celebrity who not only made us smile but changed the culture-who altered the way that we looked and behaved. In this book, we relive his thrilling life and times, which were our time too.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1603201300"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781603201308"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 80, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8bMKxgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8bMKxgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=8bMKxgEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1603201300&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=8bMKxgEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1603201300&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/LIFE_Michael_1958_2009.html?hl=&id=8bMKxgEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=8bMKxgEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "From this book&#39;s first chapter: &quot;To be able to float free, with gravity exerting no impact."}}]}

The answers will surprise and delight you as Alexandra Horowitz, a cognitive scientist, explains how dogs perceive their daily worlds, each other, and that other quirky animal, the human. Temple Grandin meets Stephen Pinker in this engaging and informative look at what goes on inside the minds of dogs\u2014from a cognitive scientist with a background at The New Yorker. With more than 52 million pet dogs in America today, it\u2019s clear we are a nation of unabashed dog-lovers. Yet the relationship between dogs and humans remains a fascinating mystery, as no one really knows what goes on in the canine mind. Now, in Inside of a Dog, Alexandra Horowitz fuses her perspectives as both scientist and dog-owner to deliver a fresh look at the world of dogs\u2014as seen from the animal\u2019s point of view. Inspired by her years of living with her own dog, Pumpernickel, who was a constant source of delight and mystery, Horowitz\u2019s mind became filled with questions and ideas. In crisp, clear prose, she draws on her research in the field of dog cognition to give readers a sense of a dog\u2019s perceptual and cognitive abilities\u2014and paints a picture of what the canine experience is like. Horowitz\u2019s own scientific journey, and the insights she uncovered, allowed her to understand her dog better and appreciate her more. Containing up-to-the minute research and providing many moments of dog-behavior recognition, this lively and absorbing book helps dog owners to see their best friend\u2019s behavior in a different, and revealing light, allowing them to understand their pets and enjoy their company even more.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1416583408"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781416583400"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 368, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Pets"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 28, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Mv1TlAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Mv1TlAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=Mv1TlAEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1416583408&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=Mv1TlAEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1416583408&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Inside_of_a_Dog.html?hl=&id=Mv1TlAEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Mv1TlAEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The bestselling book that asks what dogs know and how they think."}}]}

It was Michael's wish to bare his soul and unburden himself to a public that he knew was deeply suspicious of him. The resulting thirty hours are the basis ofThe Michael Jackson Tapes. There has never been, and never will be, anything like them. In these searingly honest conversations, Michael exposes his emotional pain and profound loneliness, his longing to be loved, and the emptiness of his fame. You discover why he was suspicious of women and how only children provided the innocence for which he so desperately longed. In his own words, he takes us into the jarring moments of his childhood and speaks of the measures he took to try and heal. He divulges how he came to be alienated from his strong religious anchor and describes his views on the nature of faith. Michael brings us into his tortured yet loving relationship with his siblings. He opens up about his father and his yearning for a time when they might finally reconcile. He talks about his most personal friendships and shares with us his terror of growing old. Despite his unprecedented fame and recent death, there remain unanswered questions about his life. The answers, presented here inThe Michael Jackson Tapes, will both intrigue and move you. You will be surprised, riveted, and troubled as you peer into the soul of a tragic icon whose life is an American morality tale and whose flame was extinguished much too early.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1593156022"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781593156022"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 299, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 2.5, "ratingsCount": 5, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZutwvgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZutwvgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=ZutwvgEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1593156022&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=ZutwvgEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1593156022&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Michael_Jackson_Tapes.html?hl=&id=ZutwvgEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ZutwvgEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "In 2000-2001, Michael Jackson sat down with his close friend and spiritual guide, Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, to record what turned out to be the most intimate and revealing conversations of his life."}}]}

Sullenberger", "Jeffrey Zaslow"], "publisher": "Harper Collins", "publishedDate": "2009-10-13", "description": "On January 15, 2009, the world witnessed one of the most remarkable emergency landings in aviation history when Captain Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger skillfully glided US Airways Flight 1549 onto the surface of the Hudson River, saving the lives of all 155 aboard. His cool actions not only averted tragedy but made him a hero and an inspiration worldwide. To Sullenberger, a calm, steady pilot with forty years of flying experience who is also a safety consulting expert, the landing was not a miracle but rather the result of years of practice and training-wisdom he gained in the cockpit of U.S. Air Force jets and in his Texas boyhood. Born to a World War II veteran and dentist father and an elementary school teacher mother, Sully fell in love with planes early. He learned to fly as an eager 16-year-old from a crop duster, an older neighbor in north Texas, who took off and landed his fragile plane on the grass field behind his house. While Sully\u2032s father encouraged his interest in flying, he also imparted stern advice he\u2032d learned from his Navy service during World War II: a commander is responsible for everyone in his care-and those words have shaped Sully\u2032s life and work and continue to guide him today. HIGHEST DUTY reveals the important lessons Sully learned through childhood, in his military service, and in his work as a commercial airline pilot. At heart, it is a story of hope and preparedness-that life\u2032s challenges can be met if we\u2032re ready for them-reminding us that, even in these days filled with war, tragedy, and economic uncertainty, there are values still worth fighting for. A few weeks after the crash, Sully discovered that he\u2032d lost a library book about professional ethics, Just Culture: Balancing Safety and Accountability, in the downed plane\u2032s cargo hold. When he called the library to notify them, they waived the usual fees.

Bush's \"new world order\" and the unprecedented governmental growth and massive redistribution of wealth under President Barack Obama, the United States risks losing the greatest middle class ever created in the history of the world. In his groundbreaking new book, Dr. Jerome R. Corsi blows the whistle on a movement to undercut the fundamental principles of limited government that our Founding Fathers fought for and died for trying to establish. As policy-makers manipulate the economic panic of our times to advance a globalist agenda that threatens American sovereignty, we must protect our independent and self-governing nation and preserve the decades of economic power and military strength we have enjoyed since the end of World War II . In America for Sale, Corsi explains the globalists' plan to put America on the chopping block. While the radical Left promotes socialism and the radical Right champions unbridled free trade, valuable jobs are being outsourced, our national borders erased, and our dollar destroyed before our very eyes. Foreign investors are buying up U.S. assets, from financial-services firms to public infrastructure such as highways. We are on our way to a European Union-type North American common market and a one-world government. With constructive solutions for resisting the global New Deal, reversing our dependence on foreign oil, and strengthening our middle class, Corsi shares important and practical strategies to help American families survive an imminent economic depression. The United States can be a major player in the world economy without sacrificing our sovereignty, the strength of our national domestic economy, or the dollar.

When Everything Changed begins in 1960, when most American women had to get their husbands' permission to apply for a credit card. It ends in 2008 with Hillary Clinton's historic presidential campaign. This was a time of cataclysmic change, when, after four hundred years, expectations about the lives of American women were smashed in just a generation. A comprehensive mix of oral history and Gail Collins's keen research--covering politics, fashion, popular culture, economics, sex, families, and work--When Everything Changed is the definitive book on five crucial decades of progress. The enormous strides made since 1960 include the advent of the birth control pill, the end of \"Help Wanted--Male\" and \"Help Wanted--Female\" ads, and the lifting of quotas for women in admission to medical and law schools. Gail Collins describes what has happened in every realm of women's lives, partly through the testimonies of both those who made history and those who simply made their way. Picking up where her highly lauded book America's Women left off, When Everything Changed is a dynamic story, told with the down-to-earth, amusing, and agenda-free tone for which this beloved New York Times columnist is known. Older readers, men and women alike, will be startled as they are reminded of what their lives once were--\"Father Knows Best\" and \"My Little Margie\" on TV; daily weigh-ins for stewardesses; few female professors; no women in the Boston marathon, in combat zones, or in the police department. Younger readers will see their history in a rich new way. It has been an era packed with drama and dreams--some dashed and others realized beyond anyone's imagining.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0316059544"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780316059541"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 480, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "averageRating": 4.0, "ratingsCount": 51, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RxZrlwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RxZrlwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=RxZrlwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0316059544&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=RxZrlwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0316059544&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/When_Everything_Changed.html?hl=&id=RxZrlwEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=RxZrlwEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "A comprehensive mix of oral history and Gail Collins&#39;s keen research--covering politics, fashion, popular culture, economics, sex, families, and work--When Everything Changed is the definitive book on five crucial decades of progress."}}]}

The Sellout traces the implosion of the financial services business back to its roots in the late 1970s when Wall Street embraced a new business model predicated on taking enormous risks. It shows how a backwater business involving the trading of risky bonds packed with mortgages showered countless billions in profits on the financial industry but sowed the seeds of its ultimate demise. Gasparino walks readers through Wall Street's three-decades' love affair with risk, revealing a trail of culpability\u2014from the government bureaucrats who crafted housing policies that encouraged homeownership, to the Wall Street firms that underwrote and invested in risky debt, to the mortgage sellers who handed out loans to people without the financial wherewithal to pay them back, to the homeowners who became convinced they could afford mansions on blue-collar wages. The ongoing tumult in financial markets and the global economy began when some of our most esteemed financial institutions, our government, and even average citizens abdicated their collective responsibilities, eventually selling out investors and selling off the American Dream itself. In the spirit of classics such as Barbarians at the Gate and Liar's Poker, this page-turning narrative captures how avarice, arrogance, and sheer stupidity eroded Wall Street's dominance and profoundly weakened the financial security of millions of middle-class Americans. Eye-opening and engrossing, The Sellout provides the most thorough investigation to date of this latest gilded era.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0061697168"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780061697166"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 576, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "averageRating": 5.0, "ratingsCount": 4, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=D8h6vwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0061697168&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=D8h6vwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0061697168&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Sellout.html?hl=&id=D8h6vwEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=D8h6vwEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Eye-opening and engrossing, The Sellout provides the most thorough investigation to date of this latest gilded era."}}]}

Faced with the prospect of being unable to explain why we eat some animals and not others, Foer set out to explore the origins of many eating traditions and the fictions involved with creating them. Traveling to the darkest corners of our dining habits, Foer raises the unspoken question behind every fish we eat, every chicken we fry, and every burger we grill.

Moses is our real founding father. The pilgrims quoted his story. Franklin and Jefferson proposed he appear on the U.S. seal. Washington and Lincoln were called his incarnations. The Statue of Liberty and Superman were molded in his image. Martin Luther King, Jr., invoked him the night before he died. Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama cited him as inspiration. For four hundred years, one figure inspired more Americans than any other. His name is Moses. In this groundbreaking book, New York Times bestselling author Bruce Feiler travels through touchstones in American history and traces the biblical prophet's influence from the Mayflower through today. He visits the island where the pilgrims spent their first Sabbath, climbs the bell tower where the Liberty Bell was inscribed with a quote from Moses, retraces the Underground Railroad where \"Go Down, Moses\" was the national anthem of slaves, and dons the robe Charlton Heston wore in The Ten Commandments. \"Even a cursory review of American history indicates that Moses has emboldened leaders of all stripes,\" Feiler writes, \"patriot and loyalist, slave and master, Jew and Christian. Could the persistence of his story serve as a reminder of our shared national values? Could he serve as a unifying force in a disunifying time? If Moses could split the Red Sea, could he unsplit America?\" One part adventure story, one part literary detective story, one part exploration of faith in contemporary life, America's Prophet takes readers through the landmarks of America's narrative\u2014from Gettysburg to Selma, the Silver Screen to the Oval Office\u2014to understand how Moses has shaped the nation's character. Meticulously researched and highly readable, America's Prophet is a thrilling, original work of history that will forever change how we view America, our faith, and our future.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780060574888"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0060574887"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 368, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Religion"], "averageRating": 4.0, "ratingsCount": 1, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0.preview.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pnMhYvgqXVIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pnMhYvgqXVIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=pnMhYvgqXVIC&dq=isbn:0060574887&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=pnMhYvgqXVIC&dq=isbn:0060574887&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/America_s_Prophet.html?hl=&id=pnMhYvgqXVIC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=pnMhYvgqXVIC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "His name is Moses.

Patti Smith would evolve as a poet and performer, and Robert Mapplethorpe would direct his highly provocative style toward photography. Bound in innocence and enthusiasm, they traversed the city from Coney Island to Forty-second Street, and eventually to the celebrated round table of Max's Kansas City, where the Andy Warhol contingent held court. In 1969, the pair set up camp at the Hotel Chelsea and soon entered a community of the famous and infamous\u2014the influential artists of the day and the colorful fringe. It was a time of heightened awareness, when the worlds of poetry, rock and roll, art, and sexual politics were colliding and exploding. In this milieu, two kids made a pact to take care of each other. Scrappy, romantic, committed to create, and fueled by their mutual dreams and drives, they would prod and provide for one another during the hungry years.

A special gift. A life-changing journey. They thought he was just a cat. When Oscar arrived at the Steere House Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Rhode Island he was a cute little guy with attitude. He loved to stretch out in a puddle of sunlight and chase his tail until he was dizzy. Occasionally he consented to a scratch behind the ears, but only when it suited him. In other words, he was a typical cat. Or so it seemed. It wasn't long before Oscar had created something of a stir. Apparently, this ordinary cat possesses an extraordinary gift: he knows instinctively when the end of life is near. Oscar is a welcome distraction for the residents of Steere House, many of whom are living with Alzheimer's. But he never spends much time with them--until they are in their last hours. Then, as if this were his job, Oscar strides purposely into a patient's room, curls up on the bed, and begins his vigil. Oscar provides comfort and companionship when people need him most. And his presence lets caregivers and loved ones know that it's time to say good-bye. Oscar's gift is a tender mercy. He teaches by example: embracing moments of life that so many of us shy away from. Making Rounds with Oscar is the story of an unusual cat, the patients he serves, their caregivers, and of one doctor who learned how to listen. Heartfelt, inspiring, and full of humor and pathos, this book allows readers to take a walk into a world rarely seen from the outside, a world we often misunderstand. Praise for Making Rounds With Oscar \"I love this book -- Oscar has much to teach us about empathy and courage. I couldn't put it down.\" -Sarah Gruen, author of Water for Elephants \"At its heart, Dosa's search is more about how people cope with death than Oscar's purported ability to predict it.\" -The Associated Press \"Beautifully written, heartwarming [...] Told with profound insight and great respect for all involved, this is more than just a cat story (although it will appeal to fans of Vicki Myron's Dewey).\" -Library Journal \"You'll be moved.\" -People", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1401323235"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781401323233"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 240, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Family & Relationships"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 93, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4OlWAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4OlWAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=4OlWAAAAYAAJ&dq=isbn:1401323235&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=4OlWAAAAYAAJ&dq=isbn:1401323235&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Making_Rounds_with_Oscar.html?hl=&id=4OlWAAAAYAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=4OlWAAAAYAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Praise for Making Rounds With Oscar &quot;I love this book -- Oscar has much to teach us about empathy and courage.

He repeated that apology when visiting Latin America, and again to Muslims worldwide in an interview broadcast on Al-Arabiya television. In No Apology, Mitt Romney asserts that American strength is essential\u2014not just for our own well-being, but for the world\u2019s. Governments such as China and a newly-robust Russia threaten to overtake us on many fronts, and Islam continues its dangerous rise. Drawing on history for lessons on how great powers collapse, Romney shows how and why our national advantages have eroded. From the long-term decline of our manufacturing base, our laggard educational system that has left us without enough engineers, scientists, and other skilled professionals, our corrupted financial practices that led to the current crisis, and the crushing impact of entitlements on our future obligations, America is in debt, overtaxed, and unprepared for the challenges it must face. We need renewal: fresh ideas to cut through complicated problems and restore our strength. Creative and bold, Romney proposes simple solutions to rebuild industry, create good jobs, reduce out of control spending on entitlements and healthcare, dramatically improve education, and restore a military battered by eight years of war. Most important, he calls for a new commitment to citizenship, a common cause we all share, rather than a laundry list of individual demands. Many of his solutions oppose President Obama\u2019s policies, many also run counter to Republican thinking, but all have one strategic aim: to move America back to political and economic strength. Personal and dynamically-argued, No Apology is a call to action by a man who cares deeply about America\u2019s history, its promise, and its future.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0312609809"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780312609801"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 336, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Political Science"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 4, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vZk-DQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vZk-DQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=vZk-DQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0312609809&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=vZk-DQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0312609809&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/No_Apology.html?hl=&id=vZk-DQEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=vZk-DQEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "In No Apology, Mitt Romney asserts that American strength is essential\u2014not just for our own well-being, but for the world\u2019s."}}]}

Written as a letter to her children, Kelly Corrigan's Lift is a tender, intimate, and robust portrait of risk and love; a touchstone for anyone who wants to live more fully. In Lift, Corrigan weaves together three true and unforgettable stories of adults willing to experience emotional hazards in exchange for the gratifications of raising children. Lift takes its name from hang gliding, a pursuit that requires flying directly into rough air, because turbulence saves a glider from \"sinking out.\" For Corrigan, this wisdom--that to fly requires chaotic, sometimes even violent passages--becomes a metaphor for all of life's most meaningful endeavors, particularly the great flight that is parenting. Corrigan serves it up straight--how mundanely and fiercely her children have been loved, how close most lives occasionally come to disaster, and how often we fall short as mothers and fathers. Lift is for everyone who has been caught off guard by the pace and vulnerability of raising children, to remind us that our work is important and our time limited. Like Anne Morrow Lindbergh's Gift from the Sea, Lift is a meditation on the complexities of a woman's life, and like Corrigan's memoir, The Middle Place, Lift is boisterous and generous, a book readers can't wait to share. Praise for Lift \"Although we've never met, I love Kelly Corrigan like a friend. Her work gives me a rich sense of intimacy with someone who is full of life and hard-fought wisdom.

I got out of ML and am doing better managing my own funds, but I could not help wondering about the integrity of our large financial institutions. So I was attracted to Harry Markopolos' tale \"No One Would Listen\" about how Bernie Madoff and the multiple feeder funds which funneled money to him ripped off the public to a degree never before even imagined . There were several salient reasons for this that we should learn to appreciate. A previous reviewer, David Bryson, argues convincingly from Markoplos' morality tale that regardless of the evidence Madoff was believed and Markoplos was not because of their relative status. Examining financial data takes time and thinking. Evaluating a persons status takes much less of both. Over and over Markopolos relates how people believed what they wanted to believe. Having worked on local political campaigns, I have seen this often and am much less surprised by this blindness and denial than the author. Yet I like to see my observations reinforced by another obviously intelligent person. Who doesn't? The bottom lines in the tale of \"No One Would Listen\" are very serious and political. Markopolos thankfully spares us the name calling, and partisanship of our current politics. Instead of vaguely and mindlessly saying (as many in politics do now) that we need more government or less government, Markopolos details how the SEC was wasting taxpayer money. He thus admits that eliminating the SEC would be better than financing an ineffective organization. I agree with previous reviewer, Stephen Whitehead, that this book is about the financial integrity of the United States. In the not too distant past that integrity and our relative political stability attracted investors from all over the world to our economic benefit. Markopolos outlines how a restructured SEC (without increasing cost) could and must play a role in maintaining the integrity of our financial markets. Markopolos also names which personnel are helpful and which should be let go. He subsequently approved of the changes the newly appointed SEC chairman, Mary Schapiro, was making as of the date his book was published. She had sought his recommendations and pursued them. We will have to read more about the SEC in future financial journals to see how many of Markopolos' suggestions were successfully deployed. Meanwhile the SEC does seem to be doing better. Last month Wall Street Journalist Susanne Craig and Kara Schannell report: \" In one of the largest penalties in Wall Street history, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. agreed to pay $550 million to settle civil charges that it duped clients by selling mortgage securities that were secretly designed by a hedge-fund firm to cash in on the housing market's collapse\". Although some critics claim the penalties should have been much larger \"The SEC said the Goldman settlement represents the largest penalty it has ever extracted from a Wall Street firm.\"", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 379, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 10, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EFGwBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EFGwBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=EFGwBQAAQBAJ&dq=isbn:0470553731&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=EFGwBQAAQBAJ&dq=isbn:0470553731&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/No_One_Would_Listen.html?hl=&id=EFGwBQAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=EFGwBQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Who doesn&#39;t?

For an entire year, otherwise clear-thinking members of the most affluent, over-educated, information-drenched generation in American history fell prey to the most expensive, hi-tech, laser-focused marketing assault in presidential campaign history. Twitter messages were machine-gunned to cell phones at mach speed. Facebook and MySpace groups spread across the Internet like digital fire. YouTube videos featuring celebrities ricocheted across the globe and into college students\u2019 in-boxes with devastating regularity. All the while, the mega-money-raising engine whirred like a slot machine stuck on jackpot. The result: an unthinking mass of young voters marched forward to elect the most radical and untested president in U.S. history. Recognized as one of the country\u2019s top young conservative activists by Human Events, Jason Mattera created an internet sensation with ambush video interviews that exposed clueless young liberals and cunning Democratic officials. Now he reveals the jaw-dropping lengths Barack Obama and his allies in Hollywood, Washington, and Academia went to in order to transform a legion of iPod-listening, MTV-watching followers into a winning coalition that threatens to become a long-lasting political realignment. Obama Zombies uncovers the true, behind-the-scenes story of the methods and tactics the Obama campaign unleashed on youth culture. Through personal interviews and meticulous original research, Mattera explains why conservatism\u2019s future rests upon jolting the young masses from their slumber, yanking out their earphones, and sparking a countercultural conservative battle against the rise of the ignorant Left.

No matter where nature has placed him--the club rooms of Brooklyn, the Mafia dives of New York's Lower East Side, the wilds of Alaska, or the hills of Hollywood--he has found a way to put on a show and sell tickets at the door. \"All life was a theater and I wanted to put it up on a stage,\" he writes. \"I wanted to set the world under a marquee that read: 'Jerry Weintraub Presents.'\" In WHEN I STOP TALKING, YOU'LL KNOW I'M DEAD, we follow Weintraub from his first great success at age twenty-six with Elvis Presley, whom he took on the road with the help of Colonel Tom Parker; to the immortal days with Sinatra and Rat Pack glory; to his crowning hits as a movie producer, starting with Robert Altman and Nashville, continuing with Oh, God!, The Karate Kid movies, and Diner, among others, and summiting with Steven Soderbergh and Ocean's Eleven, Twelve, and Thirteen. Along the way, we'll watch as Jerry moves from the poker tables of Palm Springs (the games went on for days), to the power rooms of Hollywood, to the halls of the White House, to Red Square in Moscow and the Great Palace in Beijing-all the while counseling potentates, poets, and kings, with clients and confidants like George Clooney, Bruce Willis, George H. W. Bush, Armand Hammer, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Bob Dylan, Led Zeppelin, John Denver, Bobby Fischer . . .well, the list goes on forever. And of course, the story is not yet over . . .as the old-timers say, \"The best is yet to come.\" As Weintraub says, \"When I stop talking, you'll know I'm dead.\" With wit, wisdom, and the cool confidence that has colored his remarkable career, Jerry chronicles a quintessentially American journey, one marked by luck, love, and improvisation. The stories he tells and the lessons we learn are essential, not just for those who love movies and music, but for businessmen, entrepreneurs, artists . . . everyone.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0446548154"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780446548151"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 304, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 12, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=By7_lwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=By7_lwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=By7_lwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0446548154&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=By7_lwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0446548154&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/When_I_Stop_Talking_You_ll_Know_I_m_Dead.html?hl=&id=By7_lwEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=By7_lwEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Here is the story of Jerry Weintraub: the self-made, Brooklyn-born, Bronx-raised impresario, Hollywood producer, legendary deal maker, and friend of politicians and stars."}}]}

Clarke", "Robert Knake"], "publisher": "Ecco", "publishedDate": "2010-04-20", "description": "Richard A. Clarke warned America once before about the havoc terrorism would wreak on our national security -- and he was right. Now he warns us of another threat, silent but equally dangerous. Cyber War is a powerful book about technology, government, and military strategy; about criminals, spies, soldiers, and hackers. This is the first book about the war of the future -- cyber war -- and a convincing argument that we may already be in peril of losing it. Cyber War goes behind the \"geek talk\" of hackers and computer scientists to explain clearly and convincingly what cyber war is, how cyber weapons work, and how vulnerable we are as a nation and as individuals to the vast and looming web of cyber criminals. From the first cyber crisis meeting in the White House a decade ago to the boardrooms of Silicon Valley and the electrical tunnels under Manhattan, Clarke and coauthor Robert K. Knake trace the rise of the cyber age and profile the unlikely characters and places at the epicenter of the battlefield. They recount the foreign cyber spies who hacked into the office of the Secretary of Defense, the control systems for U.S. electric power grids, and the plans to protect America's latest fighter aircraft. Economically and militarily, Clarke and Knake argue, what we've already lost in the new millennium's cyber battles is tantamount to the Soviet and Chinese theft of our nuclear bomb secrets in the 1940s and 1950s. The possibilities of what we stand to lose in an all-out cyber war -- our individual and national security among them -- are just as chilling. Powerful and convincing, Cyber War begins the critical debate about the next great threat to national security.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0061962236"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780061962233"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 304, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Political Science"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 3, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wfEdlwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wfEdlwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=wfEdlwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0061962236&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=wfEdlwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0061962236&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Cyber_War.html?hl=&id=wfEdlwEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=wfEdlwEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This is the first book about the war of the future -- cyber war -- and a convincing argument that we may already be in peril of losing it."}}]}

From its start, America has been awash in drink. The sailing vessel that brought John Winthrop to the shores of the New World in 1630 carried more beer than water. By the 1820s, liquor flowed so plentifully it was cheaper than tea. That Americans would ever agree to relinquish their booze was as improbable as it was astonishing. Yet we did, and Last Call is Daniel Okrent\u2019s dazzling explanation of why we did it, what life under Prohibition was like, and how such an unprecedented degree of government interference in the private lives of Americans changed the country forever. Writing with both wit and historical acuity, Okrent reveals how Prohibition marked a confluence of diverse forces: the growing political power of the women\u2019s suffrage movement, which allied itself with the antiliquor campaign; the fear of small-town, native-stock Protestants that they were losing control of their country to the immigrants of the large cities; the anti-German sentiment stoked by World War I; and a variety of other unlikely factors, ranging from the rise of the automobile to the advent of the income tax. Through it all, Americans kept drinking, going to remarkably creative lengths to smuggle, sell, conceal, and convivially (and sometimes fatally) imbibe their favorite intoxicants. Last Call is peopled with vivid characters of an astonishing variety: Susan B. Anthony and Billy Sunday, William Jennings Bryan and bootlegger Sam Bronfman, Pierre S. du Pont and H. L. Mencken, Meyer Lansky and the incredible\u2014if long-forgotten\u2014federal official Mabel Walker Willebrandt, who throughout the twenties was the most powerful woman in the country. (Perhaps most surprising of all is Okrent\u2019s account of Joseph P. Kennedy\u2019s legendary, and long-misunderstood, role in the liquor business.) It\u2019s a book rich with stories from nearly all parts of the country. Okrent\u2019s narrative runs through smoky Manhattan speakeasies, where relations between the sexes were changed forever; California vineyards busily producing \u201csacramental\u201d wine; New England fishing communities that gave up fishing for the more lucrative rum-running business; and in Washington, the halls of Congress itself, where politicians who had voted for Prohibition drank openly and without apology. Last Call is capacious, meticulous, and thrillingly told. It stands as the most complete history of Prohibition ever written and confirms Daniel Okrent\u2019s rank as a major American writer.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0743277023"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780743277020"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 480, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "averageRating": 4.5, "ratingsCount": 34, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Yth-lAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Yth-lAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=Yth-lAEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0743277023&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=Yth-lAEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0743277023&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Last_Call.html?hl=&id=Yth-lAEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Yth-lAEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Last Call is capacious, meticulous, and thrillingly told.

On May 20, 2010, Laura Ingraham received a package from an anonymous source that will change the history of the United States and the legacy of President Barack Obama. While retrieving her automobile from the underground garage at the Watergate complex (where she had just enjoyed her weekly pedicure), Ingraham discovered a manila envelope on the hood of her car. When she picked it up, a deep baritone voice called out from a nearby stairwell: \"Just read it. You\u2019ll know what to do.\" The shadowy figure then disappeared into the darkness without another word. The envelope contained copies of what appeared to be diary entries written by President Barack Obama, his family, and high-ranking administration officials. Because the \"diaries\" are so revealing, Ingraham felt compelled to release them to the American public and the citizens of the world. Major media outlets love to describe the president as \"no drama Obama,\" but The Obama Diaries tells a different tale. Through these \"diary entries,\" readers will see past the carefully constructed Obama fa\u00e7ade to the administration\u2019s true plans to \"remake America.\" In The Obama Diaries, Ingraham hilariously skewers the president and his minions. She takes aim at: \u2022the cynical \"razzle-dazzle\" marketing of Obama\u2019s radical agenda \u2022the use of the Obama \"brand\" and family to obscure Obama\u2019s true aims \u2022Michelle Obama\u2019s gardening and anti-obesity initiative; and much more. Informative and hugely entertaining, The Obama Diaries will inspire both laughter and critical thinking about the future of the nation and the man currently at the helm.

But until now, Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy have never told this astonishing tale in their own way and with their own words. For Leigh Anne and Sean, it all begins with family. Leigh Anne, the daughter of a tough-as-nails U.S. Marshal, decided early on that her mission was to raise children who would become \"cheerful givers.\" Sean, who grew up poor, believed that one day he could provide a home that would be \"a place of miracles.\" Together, they raised two remarkable children\u2014Collins and Sean Jr.\u2014who shared their deep Christian faith and their commitment to making a difference. And then one day Leigh Anne met a homeless African-American boy named Michael and decided that her family could be his.

After forty years, twenty-eight ODs, three botched suicides, two heart attacks, a couple of jail stints, and a debilitating stroke, Steven Adler, the most self-destructive rock star ever, is ready to share the shattering untold truth in My Appetite for Destruction. When Adler was eleven years old he told his two closest friends he was going to be a rock star in the world's greatest band. Along with four uniquely talented\u2014but very complicated and demanding\u2014musicians, Adler helped form Guns N' Roses. They rose from the streets\u2014primal rockers who obliterated glam rock and its big hair to resurrect rock's truer blues roots. They were relentless rock stars, onstage and off, taking \"sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll\" to obscene levels of reckless abandon. By the late 1980s, GNR was the biggest rock band in the world, demanding headlines, awards, and sold-out shows, with one of the greatest rock albums of all time: Appetite for Destruction. But there was a price to pay. For Adler, it was his health and his sanity, culminating in a brutal banishment by his once-beloved musical brothers. Adler digs deep, revealing the last secrets, not only his own but GNR's as well: Slash's betrayal, Axl's unpredictable temper, and Duff's revenge. He bares it all with this shocking fuck-the-fates expos\u00c9 that charts his meteoric rise and devastating collapse. Adler was humiliated and disgraced when Axl Rose kicked him out of GNR in front of an MTV audience of millions. Adler plunged into the dark side, spending most of the next twenty years in a drug-fueled hell. But he finally beat his epic addiction to crack and heroin under the care of Dr. Drew Pinsky. With Adler's newfound clarity comes a fierce determination to tell it all. Revelatory, heartbreaking, hilarious, and ultimately inspirational, you will never read anything more jaw-droppingly honest than My Appetite for Destruction.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780061917110"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0061917117"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 304, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 3.0, "ratingsCount": 4, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1O3wuV4QBEAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1O3wuV4QBEAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=1O3wuV4QBEAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:0061917117&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=1O3wuV4QBEAC&dq=isbn:0061917117&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/My_Appetite_for_Destruction.html?hl=&id=1O3wuV4QBEAC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/My_Appetite_for_Destruction-sample-epub.acsm?id=1O3wuV4QBEAC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=1O3wuV4QBEAC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "With Adler&#39;s newfound clarity comes a fierce determination to tell it all.

What's the longest a human can hold his breath? What are the limits of human performance? Welcome to The Perfection Point. Until 1954, common wisdom and scientific knowledge considered a sub-four-minute mile an impossible feat for a human. But then Roger Bannister broke that mark, followed quickly by a host of other athletes. Today the world record stands at 3 minutes, 43 seconds, yet even that number doesn't tell the full story of how fast humans can run a mile\u2014records are a mark of how well people have done, not how well they can do. What's the actual limit? The answer lies in The Perfection Point. In this fascinating and thought-provoking book, John Brenkus, the host, co-creator, and executive producer of ESPN's Sport Science, ventures across the sports world to provide an in-depth look at the absolute limits of human performance. Beginning with the current world records for a variety of sports, Brenkus finds the \u201cperfection point\u201d for each, zeroing in on the speeds, heights, distances, and times that humans will get closer to but never exceed. Combining cutting-edge science with the fundamentals of each sport, Brenkus answers questions as old as competition itself, exploring the outer realm of what's possible in athletics. Using engrossing and accessible language, he applies statistics, physics, and physiology to uncover perfection points such as: the highest dunk the longest home run the fastest mile the longest golf drive the heaviest bench press Intriguing, detailed, and controversial, the answers that Brenkus provides are essential reading for every sports fan. For years, coaches, pundits, and experts have speculated about the extremes of human ability. The Perfection Point finally provides the answers.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0061845450"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780061845451"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 256, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Sports & Recreation"], "averageRating": 4.0, "ratingsCount": 3, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YmVFmAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YmVFmAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=YmVFmAEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0061845450&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=YmVFmAEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0061845450&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Perfection_Point.html?hl=&id=YmVFmAEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=YmVFmAEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "In The Perfection Point, John Brenkus, host and creator of ESPN\u2019s Emmy Award-winning \u201cSport Science,\u201d uses hard data and scientific research to uncover the absolute limits of human performance."}}]}

In the Obama era, just as in the Bush years, these beliefs remain unquestioned gospel. In a vivid, incisive analysis, Andrew J. Bacevich succinctly presents the origins of this consensus, forged at a moment when American power was at its height. He exposes the preconceptions, biases, and habits that underlie our pervasive faith in military might, especially the notion that overwhelming superiority will oblige others to accommodate America's needs and desires\u2014whether for cheap oil, cheap credit, or cheap consumer goods. And he challenges the usefulness of our militarism as it has become both unaffordable and increasingly dangerous. Though our politicians deny it, American global might is faltering. This is the moment, Bacevich argues, to reconsider the principles which shape American policy in the world\u2014to acknowledge that fixing Afghanistan should not take precedence over fixing Detroit.

A former president of the Oxford Conservative Association, and a member of the EU Parliament, Hannan has the insight and experience to help America recapture its distinctive ideals and avoid turning into a socialist state.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780061994760"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0061994766"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 240, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Political Science"], "averageRating": 5.0, "ratingsCount": 3, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.2", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3nOSSNv3xlgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3nOSSNv3xlgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=3nOSSNv3xlgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:0061956937&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3nOSSNv3xlgC&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://market.android.com/details?id=book-3nOSSNv3xlgC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 9.49, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 9.49, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3nOSSNv3xlgC&rdid=book-3nOSSNv3xlgC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 9490000.0, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 9490000.0, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "giftable": true}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/The_New_Road_to_Serfdom-sample-epub.acsm?id=3nOSSNv3xlgC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=3nOSSNv3xlgC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "In The New Road to Serfdom, Hannan argues forcefully and passionately that Americans must not allow Barack Obama to take them down the road to European Union\u2013style social democracy."}}]}

Marilyn's image is so universal that we can't help but believe we know all there is to know of her. Every word and gesture made headlines and garnered controversy. Her serious gifts as an actor were sometimes eclipsed by her notoriety--and by the way the camera fell helplessly in love with her. Beyond the headlines--and the too-familiar stories of heartbreak and desolation--was a woman far more curious, searching, witty, and hopeful than the one the world got to know. Now, for the first time, readers can meet the private Marilyn and understand her in a way we never have before. Fragments is an unprecedented collection of written artifacts--notes to herself, letters, even poems--in Marilyn's own handwriting, never before published, along with rarely seen intimate photos. Jotted in notebooks, typed on paper, or written on hotel letterhead, these texts reveal a woman who loved deeply and strove to perfect her craft. They show a Marilyn Monroe unsparing in her analysis of her own life, but also playful, funny, and impossibly charming. The easy grace and deceptive lightness that made her performances indelible emerge on the page, as does the simmering tragedy that made her last appearances so affecting.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0374158355"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780374158354"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 256, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 4.0, "ratingsCount": 7, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=K1KlDQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=K1KlDQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=K1KlDQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0374158355&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=K1KlDQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0374158355&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Fragments.html?hl=&id=K1KlDQEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=K1KlDQEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Jotted in notebooks, typed on paper, or written on hotel letterhead, these texts reveal a woman who loved deeply and strove to perfect her craft."}}]}

An elite team of men who share a single mission: to protect the president of the United States. On November 22, 1963, these men failed\u2014and a country would never be the same. Now, for the first time, a member of JFK\u2019s Secret Service detail reveals the inside story of the assassination, the weeks and days that led to it and its heartrending aftermath. This extraordinary book is a moving, intimate portrait of dedication, courage, and loss. Drawing on the memories of his fellow agents, Jerry Blaine captures the energetic, crowd-loving young president, who banned agents from his car and often plunged into raucous crowds with little warning. He describes the careful planning that went into JFK\u2019s Texas swing, the worries and concerns that agents, working long hours with little food or rest, had during the trip. And he describes the intensely private first lady making her first-ever political appearance with her husband, just months after losing a newborn baby. Here are vivid scenes that could come only from inside the Kennedy detail: JFK\u2019s last words to his tearful son when he left Washington for the last time; how a sudden change of weather led to the choice of the open-air convertible limousine that day; Mrs. Kennedy standing blood-soaked outside a Dallas hospital room; the sudden interruption of six-year-old Caroline\u2019s long-anticipated sleepover with a friend at home; the exhausted team of agents immediately reacting to the president\u2019s death with a shift to LBJ and other key governmental figures; the agents\u2019 dismay at Jackie\u2019s decision to walk openly from the White House to St. Matthew\u2019s Cathedral at the state funeral. Most of all, this is a look into the lives of men who devoted their entire beings to protecting the presidential family: the stress of the secrecy they kept, the emotional bonds that developed, the terrible impact on agents\u2019 psyches and families, and their astonishment at the country\u2019s obsession with far-fetched conspiracy theories and finger-pointing. A book fifty years in coming, The Kennedy Detail is a portrait of incredible camaraderie and incredible heartbreak\u2014a true, must-read story of heroism in its most complex and human form. *** A medic burst out of the trauma room, and instinctively Clint Hill took a step toward Mrs. Kennedy. \u201cHe\u2019s still breathing,\u201d the man said as he rushed past. Mrs. Kennedy stood up. \u201cDo you mean he may live?\u201d she asked. No one answered. Kellerman handed the phone back to Hill and rushed back into the trauma room. \u201cClint, what happened?\u201d Jerry Behn asked earnestly. \u201cShots fired during the motorcade,\u201d Clint said as he kept an eye on Mrs. Kennedy across the hall. \u201cIt all happened so fast. We were five minutes away from the Trade Mart. . . . The situation is critical. Jerry, prepare for the worst. . . .\u201d The operator cut into the line, \u201cAttorney General Robert Kennedy wants to talk to Agent Hill.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s going on down there?!\u201d Bobby Kennedy demanded. \u201cShots fired during the motorcade,\u201d Clint repeated. \u201cThe president is very seriously injured. They\u2019re working on him now. Governor Connally was hit too.\u201d \u201cWell, what do you mean, seriously injured? How serious?\u201d Clint swallowed hard.

Widely known for his roles in the films Big Fan and Ratatouille, as well as the television hit The King of Queens, Patton Oswalt\u2014a staple of Comedy Central\u2014has been amusing audiences for decades. Now, with Zombie Spaceship Wasteland, he offers a fascinating look into his most unusual, and lovable, mindscape. Oswalt combines memoir with uproarious humor, from snow forts to Dungeons & Dragons to gifts from Grandma that had to be explained. He remem\u00adbers his teen summers spent working in a movie Cineplex and his early years doing stand-up. Readers are also treated to several graphic elements, includ\u00ading a vampire tale for the rest of us and some greeting cards with a special touch.

It is a poignant observation about the relationship between Mira, her sister, and their mentally ill mother. Before she was struck with schizophrenia at the age of nineteen, beautiful piano prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Norma Herr had been the most vibrant personality in the room. She loved her daughters and did her best to raise them well, but as her mental state deteriorated, Norma spoke less about Chopin and more about Nazis and her fear that her daughters would be kidnapped, murdered, or raped. When the girls left for college, the harassment escalated\u2014Norma called them obsessively, appeared at their apartments or jobs, threatened to kill herself if they did not return home. After a traumatic encounter, Mira and her sister were left with no choice but to change their names and sever all contact with Norma in order to stay safe. But while Mira pursued her career as an artist\u2014exploring the ancient romance of Florence, the eerie mysticism of northern Norway, and the raw desert of Israel\u2014the haunting memories of her mother were never far away. Then one day, a debilitating car accident changes Mira\u2019s life forever. Struggling to recover from a traumatic brain injury, she was confronted with a need to recontextualize her life\u2014she had to relearn how to paint, read, and interact with the outside world. In her search for a way back to her lost self, Mira reached out to the homeless shelter where she believed her mother was living and discovered that Norma was dying. Mira and her sister traveled to Cleveland, where they shared an extraordinary reconciliation with their mother that none of them had thought possible. At the hospital, Mira discovered a set of keys that opened a storage unit Norma had been keeping for seventeen years. Filled with family photos, childhood toys, and ephemera from Norma\u2019s life, the storage unit brought back a flood of previous memories that Mira had thought were lost to her forever.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1439183317"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781439183311"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 320, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 16, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jw40vQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jw40vQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=jw40vQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1439183317&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=jw40vQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1439183317&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Memory_Palace.html?hl=&id=jw40vQEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=jw40vQEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Through stunning prose and original art, The Memory Palace captures the love between mother and daughter, the complex meaning of truth, and family\u2019s capacity for forgiveness \u201cPeople have abandoned their loved ones for much less than ..."}}]}

Bergen"], "publisher": "Free Press", "publishedDate": "2011-01-11", "description": "TEN YEARS HAVE PASSED since the shocking attacks on the World Trade Center, and after seven years of conflict, the last U.S. combat troops left Iraq\u2014only to move into Afghanistan, where the ten-year-old fight continues: the war on terror rages with no clear end in sight. In The Longest War Peter Bergen offers a comprehensive history of this war and its evolution, from the strategies devised in the wake of the 9/11 attacks to the fighting in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and beyond. Unlike any other book on this subject, here Bergen tells the story of this shifting war\u2019s failures and successes from the perspectives of both the United States and al-Qaeda and its allies. He goes into the homes of al-Qaeda members, rooting into the source of their devotion to terrorist causes, and spends time in the offices of the major players shaping the U.S. strategic efforts in the region. At a time when many are frustrated or fatigued with what has become an enduring multigenerational conflict, this book will provide an illuminating narrative that not only traces the arc of the fight but projects its likely future. Weaving together internal documents from al-Qaeda and the U.S. offices of counterterrorism, first-person interviews with top-level jihadists and senior Washington officials, along with his own experiences on the ground in the Middle East, Bergen balances the accounts of each side, revealing how al-Qaeda has evolved since 9/11 and the specific ways the U.S. government has responded in the ongoing fight. Bergen also uncovers the strategic errors committed on both sides\u2014the way that al-Qaeda\u2019s bold attack on the United States on 9/11 actually undermined its objective and caused the collapse of the Taliban and the destruction of the organization\u2019s safe haven in Afghanistan, and how al-Qaeda is actually losing the war of ideas in the Muslim world. The book also shows how the United States undermined its moral position in this war with its actions at Guant\u00e1namo and coercive interrogations\u2014including the extraordinary rendition of Abu Omar, who was kidnapped by the CIA in Milan in 2003 and was tortured for four years in Egyptian prisons; his case represents the first and only time that CIA officials have been charged and convicted of the crime of kidnapping. In examining other strategic blunders the United States has committed, Bergen offers a scathing critique of the Clinton and Bush administrations\u2019 inability to accurately assess and counter the al-Qaeda threat, Bush\u2019s deeply misguided reasons for invading Iraq\u2014including the story of how the invasion was launched based, in part, on the views of an obscure academic who put forth theories about Iraq\u2019s involvement with al-Qaeda\u2014and the Obama administration\u2019s efforts in Afghanistan.

Michael Waltrip and Dale Earnhardt Jr. were running one-two. Junior's legendary dad, the driver race fans called \"The Intimidator,\" was close behind in third, blocking anyone who might try to pass. Waltrip couldn't stop thinking about all the times he'd struggled to stay ahead--and the 462 NASCAR Cup races he'd lost without a single win. He'd been a race-car driver all his adult life, following in the footsteps of his brother Darrell, a three-time NASCAR champion. And his losing streak was getting more painful every race. But this day, he knew, could be different. He was driving for Dale Earnhardt now, racing as a team with his close friend and mentor. Yet as his car roared toward the finish line, ending that losing streak once and for all, Waltrip had no clue that the greatest triumph of his life could get mired in terrible tragedy. This is the story of that fateful afternoon in Daytona, a day whose echoes are still heard today. But the story begins years earlier in a small town in Kentucky, with a boy who dreamed of racing cars, a boy who was determined to go from go-karts to the highest levels of NASCAR. For the first time ever, Michael Waltrip tells the full, revealing story of how he got to Daytona, what happened there, and the huge impact it had on so many in the racing world. He reveals for the first time how his own life changed as he dealt with guilt, faced his grief, and searched for the fortitude to climb into a race car again. It's an inspiring and powerful story, told with Michael's trademark humor, honesty, and irreverence. It's a story of family, fulfillment, and redemption--and well-earned victory in the end.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1401324312"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781401324315"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 240, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 4.5, "ratingsCount": 3, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=z7xQvwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=z7xQvwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=z7xQvwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1401324312&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=z7xQvwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1401324312&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/In_the_Blink_of_an_Eye.html?hl=&id=z7xQvwEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=z7xQvwEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This is the story of that fateful afternoon in Daytona, a day whose echoes are still heard today."}}]}

Now, with the intellectual curiosity and emotional wisdom that make his columns among the most read in the nation, Brooks turns to the building blocks of human flourishing in a multilayered, profoundly illuminating work grounded in everyday life. This is the story of how success happens. It is told through the lives of one composite American couple, Harold and Erica\u2014how they grow, push forward, are pulled back, fail, and succeed. Distilling a vast array of information into these two vividly realized characters, Brooks illustrates a fundamental new understanding of human nature. A scientific revolution has occurred\u2014we have learned more about the human brain in the last thirty years than we had in the previous three thousand. The unconscious mind, it turns out, is most of the mind\u2014not a dark, vestigial place but a creative and enchanted one, where most of the brain's work gets done. This is the realm of emotions, intuitions, biases, longings, genetic predispositions, personality traits, and social norms: the realm where character is formed and where our most important life decisions are made. The natural habitat of The Social Animal. Drawing on a wealth of current research from numerous disciplines, Brooks takes Harold and Erica from infancy to school; from the \u201codyssey years\u201d that have come to define young adulthood to the high walls of poverty; from the nature of attachment, love, and commitment, to the nature of effective leadership. He reveals the deeply social aspect of our very minds and exposes the bias in modern culture that overemphasizes rationalism, individualism, and IQ. Along the way, he demolishes conventional definitions of success while looking toward a culture based on trust and humility. The Social Animal is a moving and nuanced intellectual adventure, a story of achievement and a defense of progress. Impossible to put down, it is an essential book for our time, one that will have broad social impact and will change the way we see ourselves and the world.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781400067602"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "140006760X"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 424, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Psychology"], "averageRating": 4.0, "ratingsCount": 25, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.0.0.preview.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=00rD7TgIOVgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=00rD7TgIOVgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=00rD7TgIOVgC&dq=isbn:140006760X&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=00rD7TgIOVgC&dq=isbn:140006760X&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Social_Animal.html?hl=&id=00rD7TgIOVgC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": true}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=00rD7TgIOVgC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This is the story of how success happens.

This is the life of Sammy Hagar. For almost forty years, Sammy Hagar has been a fixture in rock music. From breaking into the industry with the band Montrose to his multiplatinum solo career to his ride as the front man of Van Halen, Sammy's powerful and unforgettable voice has set the tone for some of the greatest rock anthems ever written\u2014songs like \"I Can't Drive 55,\" \"Right Now,\" and \"Why Can't This Be Love.\" In Red, Sammy tells the outrageous story of his tear through rock 'n' roll, detailing the backstage antics and nonstop touring that have made his voice instantly recognizable. Beginning with his musical coming-of-age in the blue-collar towns of California, Sammy traces his rough and determined rise to fame, working harder than anyone else out there and writing songs about the things he loved\u2014fast cars, loud parties, and lots of good times. But solo success was just the start, a prelude to his raucous and notorious decade as the front man for Van Halen, one of the biggest-selling rock groups in history. Filled with behind-the-scenes stories from his time with the band, Red offers the Van Halen story as Sammy saw it, holding nothing back about the worldwide stadium tours, the tensions with Eddie, the messy parties, the divided friendships, and, of course, his controversial and widely disputed exit from the band. After Van Halen, Sammy changed directions again, throwing himself headfirst into the tequila business and creating Cabo Wabo, one of the most successful tequila brands in the world. And all the while he continued to rock, touring the country with his bands the Waboritas and Chickenfoot, and eventually reuniting with Van Halen for a tour that became both a box-office smash and a personal catastrophe. From the decadence of being one of the world's biggest rock stars to the unfiltered story of being forced out of Van Halen, Sammy's account spares no one, least of all himself. His is a tale of a true rock 'n' roller\u2014someone who's spent decades bringing the party with him wherever he goes but always headin' back to Cabo for mas tequila.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780062009289"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0062009281"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 256, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 4.5, "ratingsCount": 22, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.2.0.0.preview.2", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AxwO8nc74hgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AxwO8nc74hgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=AxwO8nc74hgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:0062009281&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=AxwO8nc74hgC&dq=isbn:0062009281&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Red.html?hl=&id=AxwO8nc74hgC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/Red-sample-epub.acsm?id=AxwO8nc74hgC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=AxwO8nc74hgC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Loud rock, fast cars, and Cabo.

After receiving a teaching degree during the civil war\u2014a rare achievement for any Afghan woman\u2014Kamila was subsequently banned from school and confined to her home. When her father and brother were forced to flee the city, Kamila became the sole breadwinner for her five siblings. Armed only with grit and determination, she picked up a needle and thread and created a thriving business of her own. The Dressmaker of Khair Khana tells the incredible true story of this unlikely entrepreneur who mobilized her community under the Taliban. Former ABC News reporter Gayle Tzemach Lemmon spent years on the ground reporting Kamila's story, and the result is an unusually intimate and unsanitized look at the daily lives of women in Afghanistan. These women are not victims; they are the glue that holds families together; they are the backbone and the heart of their nation. Afghanistan's future remains uncertain as debates over withdrawal timelines dominate the news. The Dressmaker of Khair Khana moves beyond the headlines to transport you to an Afghanistan you have never seen before. This is a story of war, but it is also a story of sisterhood and resilience in the face of despair.

You can reach that high. Never be afraid because you can be anything you want to be.\" Susan Lucci was only five years old when her father shared these encouraging words with her. They inspired the highly imaginative child who loved make-believe to craft one of the most enduring characters in television history, an achievement that would earn her a record twenty-one Emmy nominations\u2014the most for an actor in the award's history\u2014and the crown as \"Leading Lady of Daytime.\" When Lucci and All My Children were introduced to the world in 1971, American television changed forever. Susan's character, the beautiful, spirited, and mercurial Erica Kane, was an original\u2014the first vixen viewers loved to hate. But while millions have enjoyed getting to know Erica's many sides\u2014and have been awed at how this character has continually remade herself\u2014the woman who plays her has remained a mystery. In her long-awaited memoir, this very private actress, wife, mother, daughter, grandmother, sister, friend, and entrepreneur pulls back the curtain to reveal her story. Susan, like Erica Kane, has undergone a metamorphosis many times. All My Life shares the stories of those transformations: starring in roles on television and stage, where she took Broadway not just by storm but \"by tsunami\" as one critic raved about her performance in Annie Get Your Gun; mounting successful cabaret acts (solo and with Regis Philbin); bringing art and joy back to New York in the wake of 9/11; conquering the tango with Tony Dovolani on ABC's hit show Dancing with the Stars; and building a successful career as an entrepreneur with a signature line of products. Susan goes beyond her success to talk about the darker moments, too, including the childhood guilt she harbored over the death of her dear grandmother, the car accident that nearly took away her career and her eyesight, her newborn son's life-threatening illness, coping with her husband's cancer, and the pain of miscarriage\u2014one of the many parallels between her Erica Kane. As charming, down-to-earth, and compelling as the woman whose story it tells, All My Life shines a spotlight on one of our most popular stars and reminds us of the power of dreams and how we can find the courage and tenacity to make them come true.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780062061867"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0062061860"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 368, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 3.0, "ratingsCount": 4, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.2", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jJfgCKnJZLoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jJfgCKnJZLoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=jJfgCKnJZLoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:0062061844&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=jJfgCKnJZLoC&dq=isbn:0062061844&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/All_My_Life.html?hl=&id=jJfgCKnJZLoC"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/All_My_Life-sample-epub.acsm?id=jJfgCKnJZLoC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=jJfgCKnJZLoC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "All My Life shares the stories of those transformations: starring in roles on television and stage, where she took Broadway not just by storm but &quot;by tsunami&quot; as one critic raved about her performance in Annie Get Your Gun; mounting ..."}}]}

In Forged, Ehrman\u2019s fresh and original research takes readers back to the ancient world, where forgeries were used as weapons by unknown authors to fend off attacks to their faith and establish their church. So, if many of the books in the Bible were not in fact written by Jesus\u2019s inner circle\u2014but by writers living decades later, with differing agendas in rival communities\u2014what does that do to the authority of Scripture? Ehrman investigates ancient sources to: Reveal which New Testament books were outright forgeries.

Collected by the Ronald Reagan Foundation, the book includes both Reagan\u2019s own writing and his favorite quotations, proverbs, and excerpts from speeches, poetry, and literature. The breadth of these notes sheds light on a man who was deeply engaged with the arts, culture, and politics, from his time as one of the nation\u2019s most popular actors to later years as one of its most beloved presidents. Known as the \u201cGreat Communicator,\u201d Reagan sought wisdom from a wide-ranging set of political figures, philosophers, novelists, and poets, including Abraham Lincoln, Daniel Webster, John F. Kennedy, and Thomas Jefferson, as well as Mohandas Gandhi, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Mark Twain, and Thomas Wolfe. While the number one New York Times bestselling Reagan Diaries detailed daily life inside the Oval Office, The Notes encapsulates a lifetime of reflections on work, marriage, and family in classic one-liners such as \u201cFlattery is what makes husbands out of bachelors\u201d and \u201cMoney may not buy friends, but it will help you to stay in contact with your children.\u201d Reagan\u2019s own writing\u2014his jokes, aphorisms, and insights into politics and life\u2014is often surprising and reveals a view of the president that has rarely before been seen.

After risking the hazardous journey across the Atlantic, these Americans embarked on a greater journey in the City of Light. Most had never left home, never experienced a different culture. None had any guarantee of success. That they achieved so much for themselves and their country profoundly altered American history. As David McCullough writes, \u201cNot all pioneers went west.\u201d Elizabeth Blackwell, the first female doctor in America, was one of this intrepid band. Another was Charles Sumner, who enrolled at the Sorbonne because of a burning desire to know more about everything. There he saw black students with the same ambition he had, and when he returned home, he would become the most powerful, unyielding voice for abolition in the U.S. Senate, almost at the cost of his life. Two staunch friends, James Fenimore Cooper and Samuel F. B. Morse, worked unrelentingly every day in Paris, Cooper writing and Morse painting what would be his masterpiece. From something he saw in France, Morse would also bring home his momentous idea for the telegraph. Pianist Louis Moreau Gottschalk from New Orleans launched his spectacular career performing in Paris at age 15. George P. A. Healy, who had almost no money and little education, took the gamble of a lifetime and with no prospects whatsoever in Paris became one of the most celebrated portrait painters of the day. His subjects included Abraham Lincoln. Medical student Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote home of his toil and the exhilaration in \u201cbeing at the center of things\u201d in what was then the medical capital of the world. From all they learned in Paris, Holmes and his fellow \u201cmedicals\u201d were to exert lasting influence on the profession of medicine in the United States. Writers Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Mark Twain, and Henry James were all \u201cdiscovering\u201d Paris, marveling at the treasures in the Louvre, or out with the Sunday throngs strolling the city\u2019s boulevards and gardens. \u201cAt last I have come into a dreamland,\u201d wrote Harriet Beecher Stowe, seeking escape from the notoriety Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin had brought her. Almost forgotten today, the heroic American ambassador Elihu Washburne bravely remained at his post through the Franco-Prussian War, the long Siege of Paris and even more atrocious nightmare of the Commune. His vivid account in his diary of the starvation and suffering endured by the people of Paris (drawn on here for the first time) is one readers will never forget. The genius of sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens, the son of an immigrant shoemaker, and of painters Mary Cassatt and John Singer Sargent, three of the greatest American artists ever, would flourish in Paris, inspired by the examples of brilliant French masters, and by Paris itself. Nearly all of these Americans, whatever their troubles learning French, their spells of homesickness, and their suffering in the raw cold winters by the Seine, spent many of the happiest days and nights of their lives in Paris. McCullough tells this sweeping, fascinating story with power and intimacy, bringing us into the lives of remarkable men and women who, in Saint-Gaudens\u2019s phrase, longed \u201cto soar into the blue.\u201d The Greater Journey is itself a masterpiece.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1416571760"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781416571766"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 576, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 980, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lxoQlQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lxoQlQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=lxoQlQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1416571760&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=lxoQlQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1416571760&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Greater_Journey.html?hl=&id=lxoQlQEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=lxoQlQEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "McCullough tells this sweeping, fascinating story with power and intimacy, bringing us into the lives of remarkable men and women who, in Saint-Gaudens\u2019s phrase, longed \u201cto soar into the blue.\u201d The Greater Journey is itself a ..."}}]}

Fareed Zakaria\u2019s international bestseller The Post-American World pointed to the \u201crise of the rest\u201d\u2014the growth of countries like China, India, Brazil, and others\u2014as the great story of our time, the story that will undoubtedly shape the future of global power. Since its publication, the trends he identified have proceeded faster than anyone could have anticipated. The 2008 financial crisis turned the world upside down, stalling the United States and other advanced economies. Meanwhile emerging markets have surged ahead, coupling their economic growth with pride, nationalism, and a determination to shape their own future. In this new edition, Zakaria makes sense of this rapidly changing landscape. With his customary lucidity, insight, and imagination, he draws on lessons from the two great power shifts of the past 500 years\u2014the rise of the Western world and the rise of the United States\u2014to tell us what we can expect from the third shift, the \u201crise of the rest.\u201d The great challenge for Britain was economic decline. The challenge for America now is political decline, for as others have grown in importance, the central role of the United States, especially in the ascendant emerging markets, has already begun to shrink. As Zakaria eloquently argues, Washington needs to begin a serious transformation of its global strategy, moving from its traditional role of dominating hegemon to that of a more pragmatic, honest broker. It must seek to share power, create coalitions, build legitimacy, and define the global agenda\u2014all formidable tasks. None of this will be easy for the greatest power the world has ever known\u2014the only power that for so long has really mattered. America stands at a crossroads: In a new global era where the United States no longer dominates the worldwide economy, orchestrates geopolitics, or overwhelms cultures, can the nation continue to thrive?", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "039308180X"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780393081800"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 336, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Political Science"], "averageRating": 4.0, "ratingsCount": 30, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AwVCtQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AwVCtQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=AwVCtQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:039308180X&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=AwVCtQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:039308180X&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Post_American_World.html?hl=&id=AwVCtQEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=AwVCtQEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Fareed Zakaria\u2019s international bestseller The Post-American World pointed to the \u201crise of the rest\u201d\u2014the growth of countries like China, India, Brazil, and others\u2014as the great story of our time, the story that will undoubtedly ..."}}]}

In their new book, they share practical insights about the joys and challenges of parenting with faith. In this second book from the Duggars, they focus on the principles that equip them to face life's challenges\u2014drawing from their most recent challenge with the 3-month premature birth of their newest child, Josie. They also share the new challenges their older children are facing as they prepare for adult life. Central to the book is a section on the principles that the Duggars have consistently taught their children. These simply worded principles are basic to the Duggar family and are shared in a way that other parents can incorporate in their own homes. A special chapter on homeschooling gives valuable information to parents who are considering this route or are already invested in it. The world continues to be amazed by their nineteen well-groomed, well-behaved, well-schooled children and their home life, which focuses on family, financial responsibility, fun\u2014and must importantly, faith. The Duggars show how parents can succeed whether they\u2019re rearing a single child or several. Table of Contents Preface: Our Biggest Test Begins Part 1: Little Baby, Big Challenges 1.

He accessed computers and networks at the world's biggest companies--and however fast the authorities were, Mitnick was faster, sprinting through phone switches, computer systems, and cellular networks. He spent years skipping through cyberspace, always three steps ahead and labeled unstoppable. But for Kevin, hacking wasn't just about technological feats-it was an old fashioned confidence game that required guile and deception to trick the unwitting out of valuable information. Driven by a powerful urge to accomplish the impossible, Mitnick bypassed security systems and blazed into major organizations including Motorola, Sun Microsystems, and Pacific Bell. But as the FBI's net began to tighten, Kevin went on the run, engaging in an increasingly sophisticated cat and mouse game that led through false identities, a host of cities, plenty of close shaves, and an ultimate showdown with the Feds, who would stop at nothing to bring him down.

In this book she braids a multilayered narrative around the perfectly lit, Happy Valley era Africa of her mother's childhood; the boiled cabbage grimness of her father's English childhood; and the darker, civil war torn Africa of her own childhood. At its heart, this is the story of Fuller's mother, Nicola. Born on the Scottish Isle of Skye and raised in Kenya, Nicola holds dear the kinds of values most likely to get you hurt or killed in Africa: loyalty to blood, passion for land, and a holy belief in the restorative power of all animals. The author interviewed her mother at length and has captured her inimitable voice with remarkable precision. We see Nicola and Tim Fuller in their lavender colored honeymoon period, when east Africa lies before them with all the promise of its liquid equatorial light, even as the British empire in which they both believe wanes. But in short order, an accumulation of mishaps and tragedies bump up against history until the couple finds themselves in a world they hardly recognize. We follow the Fullers as they hopscotch the continent, running from war and unspeakable heartbreak, from Kenya to Rhodesia to Zambia, even returning to England briefly. But just when it seems that Nicola has been broken entirely by Africa, it is the African earth itself that revives her. A story of survival and madness, love and war, loyalty and forgiveness, this book is an intimate exploration of the author's family. In the end we find Nicola and Tim at a coffee table under their Tree of Forgetfulness on the banana and fish farm where they plan to spend their final days. In local custom, the Tree of Forgetfulness is where villagers meet to resolve disputes and it is here that the Fullers at last find an African kind of peace. -- From publisher.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1594202982"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781594202988"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 238, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography"], "averageRating": 4.0, "ratingsCount": 24, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=IQoCoQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1594202982&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=IQoCoQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1594202982&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Cocktail_Hour_Under_the_Tree_of_Forgetfu.html?hl=&id=IQoCoQEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=IQoCoQEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "At its heart, this is the story of Fuller&#39;s mother, Nicola."}}]}

By that measure, the essays of Christopher Hitchens are in the first tier. For nearly four decades, Hitchens has been telling us, in pitch-perfect prose, what we confront when we grapple with first principles-the principles of reason and tolerance and skepticism that define and inform the foundations of our civilization-principles that, to endure, must be defended anew by every generation. \"A short list of the greatest living conversationalists in English,\" said The Economist, \"would probably have to include Christopher Hitchens, Sir Patrick Leigh-Fermor, and Sir Tom Stoppard. Great brilliance, fantastic powers of recall, and quick wit are clearly valuable in sustaining conversation at these cosmic levels. Charm may be helpful, too.\" Hitchens-who staunchly declines all offers of knighthood-hereby invites you to take a seat at a democratic conversation, to be engaged, and to be reasoned with. His knowledge is formidable, an encyclopedic treasure, and yet one has the feeling, reading him, of hearing a person thinking out loud, following the inexorable logic of his thought, wherever it might lead, unafraid to expose fraudulence, denounce injustice, and excoriate hypocrisy. Legions of readers, admirers and detractors alike, have learned to read Hitchens with something approaching awe at his felicity of language, the oxygen in every sentence, the enviable wit and his readiness, even eagerness, to fight a foe or mount the ramparts. Here, he supplies fresh perceptions of such figures as varied as Charles Dickens, Karl Marx, Rebecca West, George Orwell, J.G. Ballard, and Philip Larkin are matched in brilliance by his pungent discussions and intrepid observations, gathered from a lifetime of traveling and reporting from such destinations as Iran, China, and Pakistan. Hitchens's directness, elegance, lightly carried erudition, critical and psychological insight, humor, and sympathy-applied as they are here to a dazzling variety of subjects-all set a standard for the essayist that has rarely been matched in our time. What emerges from this indispensable volume is an intellectual self-portrait of a writer with an exemplary steadiness of purpose and a love affair with the delights and seductions of the English language, a man anchored in a profound and humane vision of the human longing for reason and justice.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1455502774"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781455502776"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 816, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Literary Collections"], "averageRating": 4.0, "ratingsCount": 23, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QcjjtAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QcjjtAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=QcjjtAEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1455502774&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=QcjjtAEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1455502774&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Arguably.html?hl=&id=QcjjtAEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=QcjjtAEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "What emerges from this indispensable volume is an intellectual self-portrait of a writer with an exemplary steadiness of purpose and a love affair with the delights and seductions of the English language, a man anchored in a profound and ..."}}]}

Kennedy. Now, for the first time, they can be heard and read in this deluxe, illustrated book and 8-CD set. Shortly after President John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination, with a nation deep in mourning and the world looking on in stunned disbelief, Jacqueline Kennedy found the strength to set aside her own personal grief for the sake of posterity and begin the task of documenting and preserving her husband\u2019s legacy. In January of 1964, she and Robert F. Kennedy approved a planned oral-history project that would capture their first-hand accounts of the late President as well as the recollections of those closest to him throughout his extraordinary political career. For the rest of her life, the famously private Jacqueline Kennedy steadfastly refused to discuss her memories of those years, but beginning that March, she fulfilled her obligation to future generations of Americans by sitting down with historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., and recording an astonishingly detailed and unvarnished account of her experiences and impressions as the wife and confidante of John F. Kennedy. The tapes of those sessions were then sealed and later deposited in the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum upon its completion, in accordance with Mrs. Kennedy\u2019s wishes. The resulting eight and a half hours of material comprises a unique and compelling record of a tumultuous era, providing fresh insights on the many significant people and events that shaped JFK\u2019s presidency but also shedding new light on the man behind the momentous decisions. Here are JFK\u2019s unscripted opinions on a host of revealing subjects, including his thoughts and feelings about his brothers Robert and Ted, and his take on world leaders past and present, giving us perhaps the most informed, genuine, and immediate portrait of John Fitzgerald Kennedy we shall ever have. Mrs. Kennedy\u2019s urbane perspective, her candor, and her flashes of wit also give us our clearest glimpse into the active mind of a remarkable First Lady. In conjunction with the fiftieth anniversary of President Kennedy\u2019s Inauguration, Caroline Kennedy and the Kennedy family are now releasing these beautifully restored recordings on CDs with accompanying transcripts. Introduced and annotated by renowned presidential historian Michael Beschloss, these interviews will add an exciting new dimension to our understanding and appreciation of President Kennedy and his time and make the past come alive through the words and voice of an eloquent eyewitness to history.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1401324258"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781401324254"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 400, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["History"], "averageRating": 4.5, "ratingsCount": 20, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false, "containsImageBubbles": false}, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DLAnxgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DLAnxgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=DLAnxgEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1401324258&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=DLAnxgEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1401324258&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Jacqueline_Kennedy.html?hl=&id=DLAnxgEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=DLAnxgEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "In 1964, Jacqueline Kennedy recorded seven historic interviews about her life with John F.

Anyone can do that. Trying to figure out the why or what is a different story. Paranormal investigator Zak Bagans, host of the popular Travel Channel series Ghost Adventures, pulls from his years of experience with paranormal activities and unexplained phenomena to provide an evenhanded look at a divisive subject. In Dark World, regardless of whether you believe in the afterlife or not, Zak does his best to find and share answers to the phenomena that people encounter. He wants you to experience a haunting through his eyes: to feel what it's like to be scared, freaked out, pushed, cold, sluggish, whispered-at and touched by an ethereal being or attacked by a demonic spirit. But beyond simply experiencing these events, Zak is looking for the reasons behind them, searching for answers to the unanswered questions. Addressing all the major issues and theories of the field in an impartial way, Dark World is a must read for paranormal enthusiasts, those who don't believe and anyone who's ever wondered about things that go bump in the night.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1936608855"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781936608850"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 272, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Body, Mind & Spirit"], "averageRating": 4.0, "ratingsCount": 4, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aPsWtwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aPsWtwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=aPsWtwAACAAJ&dq=isbn:1936608855&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=aPsWtwAACAAJ&dq=isbn:1936608855&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Dark_World.html?hl=&id=aPsWtwAACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=aPsWtwAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "In Dark World, regardless of whether you believe in the afterlife or not, Zak does his best to find and share answers to the phenomena that people encounter."}}]}

Now she reveals her private side, sharing the ups and downs, the joys and challenges of motherhood, marriage, and life in the spotlight. In this intimate follow-up to her New York Times bestseller, Sliding into Home, Kendra confides her most candid thoughts and feelings on her experiences as a new mom, and she divulges her secrets on how to do it all and make it look easy, sexy, and fun\u2014even when it\u2019s not. Now with a husband and baby in her life, a booming brand to manage, and her own needs to think about too, Kendra is learning the art of balance, sometimes the hard way. Not wanting to pawn her child off to nannies like so many other stars, Kendra relishes the role of supermom\u2014kissing boo-boos, making lunches, scheduling playdates\u2014all while juggling appearances, workout videos, and even training for the ultra-competitive hit show Dancing with the Stars. While Being Kendra is full of humor and true stories that women can relate to, it\u2019s also a heartrending look at Kendra\u2019s very personal journey through some dark places, including a private struggle with postpartum depression and a very public tussle with post-baby weight loss. Kendra, who has always been known for her athletic (and enhanced) figure, opens up about her efforts to get her bikini body back and the difficulty of not looking sexy, which she believed was her most valuable quality. Her fight to lose weight at any cost, chronicled on the covers of countless magazines, has become yet another triumph for Kendra as she continues to succeed in the face of adversity. From dental assistant, to Playboy girlfriend and face of a franchise, to wife and new mother, Kendra has embraced what life has thrown at her with determination, fortitude, and a ready laugh. This daring and honest memoir captures Kendra and her family in their best and worst moments as she lives, loves, rebounds, and, ultimately, finds her place in her new world.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780062091185"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0062091182"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 240, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 2.5, "ratingsCount": 2, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vUnoIsScuz4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vUnoIsScuz4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=vUnoIsScuz4C&pg=PP1&dq=isbn:0062091182&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=vUnoIsScuz4C&dq=isbn:0062091182&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Being_Kendra.html?hl=&id=vUnoIsScuz4C"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=vUnoIsScuz4C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "While Being Kendra is full of humor and true stories that women can relate to, it\u2019s also a heartrending look at Kendra\u2019s very personal journey through some dark places, including a private struggle with postpartum depression and a very ..."}}]}
