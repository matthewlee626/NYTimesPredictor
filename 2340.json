KISS formed in 1973 and broke new ground with their elaborate makeup, live theatrics, and powerful sound. The band emerged as one of the most iconic hard rock acts in music history. Peter Criss, the Catman, was the heartbeat of the group. From an elevated perch on his pyrotechnic drum riser, he had a unique vantage point on the greatest rock show of all time, with the KISS Army looking back at him night after night. Peter Criscuola had come a long way from the homemade drum set he pounded on nonstop as a kid growing up in Brooklyn in the fifties. He endured lean years, street violence, and the rollercoaster music scene of the sixties, but he always knew he\u2019d make it. Makeup to Breakup is Peter Criss\u2019s eye-opening journey from the pledge to his ma that he\u2019d one day play Madison Square Garden to doing just that. He conquered the rock world\u2014composing and singing his band\u2019s all-time biggest hit, \u201cBeth\u201d (1976)\u2014but he also faced the perils of stardom and his own mortality, including drug abuse, treatment in 1982, near-suicides, two broken marriages, and a hard-won battle with breast cancer. Criss opens up with a level of honesty and emotion previously unseen in any musician\u2019s memoir. Makeup to Breakup is the definitive and heartfelt account of one of rock\u2019s most iconic figures, and the importance of faith and family.

Mostly, though, it hit a nerve among the general public who question the role of Wall Street in society -- and the callous \"take-the-money-and-run\" mentality that brought the world economy to its knees a few short years ago. Smith now picks up where his Op-Ed left off. His story begins in the summer of 2000, when an idealistic 21-year-old arrives as an intern at Goldman Sachs and learns about the firm's Business Principle #1: Our clients' interests always come first. This remains Smith's mantra as he rises from intern to analyst to sales trader, with clients controlling assets of more than a trillion dollars. From the shenanigans of his summer internship during the technology bubble to Las Vegas hot tubs and the excesses of the real estate boom; from the career lifeline he received from an NFL Hall of Famer during the bear market to the day Warren Buffett came to save Goldman Sachs from extinction-Smith will take the reader on his personal journey through the firm, and bring us inside the world's most powerful bank. Smith describes in page-turning detail how the most storied investment bank on Wall Street went from taking iconic companies like Ford, Sears, and Microsoft public to becoming a \"vampire squid\" that referred to its clients as \"muppets\" and paid the government a record half-billion dollars to settle SEC charges. He shows the evolution of Wall Street into an industry riddled with conflicts of interest and a profit-at-all-costs mentality: a perfectly rigged game at the expense of the economy and the society at large. After conversations with nine Goldman Sachs partners over a twelve-month period proved fruitless, Smith came to believe that the only way the system would ever change was for an insider to finally speak out publicly. He walked away from his career and took matters into his own hands.

Sacks"], "publisher": "Alfred a Knopf Incorporated", "publishedDate": "2012", "description": "Have you ever seen something that wasn't really there? Heard someone call your name in an empty house? Sensed someone following you and turned around to find nothing? Hallucinations don't belong wholly to the insane. Much more commonly, they are linked to sensory deprivation, intoxication, illness, or injury. People with migraines may see shimmering arcs of light or tiny, Lilliputian figures of animals and people. People with failing eyesight, paradoxically, may become immersed in a hallucinatory visual world. Hallucinations can be brought on by a simple fever or even the act of waking or falling asleep, when people have visions ranging from luminous blobs of color to beautifully detailed faces or terrifying ogres. Those who are bereaved may receive comforting \"visits\" from the departed. In some conditions, hallucinations can lead to religious epiphanies or even the feeling of leaving one's own body. Humans have always sought such life-changing visions, and for thousands of years have used hallucinogenic compounds to achieve them. As a young doctor in California in the 1960s, Oliver Sacks had both a personal and a professional interest in psychedelics. These, along with his early migraine experiences, launched a lifelong investigation into the varieties of hallucinatory experience. Here, with his usual elegance, curiosity, and compassion, Dr. Sacks weaves together stories of his patients and of his own mind-altering experiences to illuminate what hallucinations tell us about the organization and structure of our brains, how they have influenced every culture's folklore and art, and why the potential for hallucination is present in us all, a vital part of the human condition.

But beneath the water is a chaotic ballet of bared teeth and bubbles, paddling paws, fur and ears billowing in the currents. From leaping Lab to diving Dachshund, the water is where a dog's distinct personality shines through; some lounge in the current, paddling slowly, but others arch their bodies to cut through the water with the focus and determination of a shark. In more than eighty portraits, award-winning pet photographer and animal rights activist Seth Casteel captures new sides of our old friends with vibrant underwater photography that makes it impossible to look away. Each image bubbles with exuberance and life, a striking reminder that even in the most loveable and domesticated dog, there are more primal forces at work. In Underwater Dogs, Seth Casteel gives playful and energetic testament to the rough-and-tumble joy that our dogs bring into our lives.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0316227706"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780316227704"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 144, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Photography"], "averageRating": 5.0, "ratingsCount": 4, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JYyhuAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JYyhuAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=JYyhuAAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0316227706&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=JYyhuAAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0316227706&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Underwater_Dogs.html?hl=&id=JYyhuAAACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=JYyhuAAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "In Underwater Dogs, Seth Casteel gives playful and energetic testament to the rough-and-tumble joy that our dogs bring into our lives."}}]}

He discovered, developed and launched the careers of many superstars, including Mariah Carey, Celine Dion, Shakira, Jennifer Lopez and Gloria Estefan, and is credited with creating the \"Latin Explosion.\" He has had the privilege of working alongside Bruce Springsteen, Billy Joel, Bob Dylan, Beyonce, Michael Jackson, Barbara Streisand, the Dixie Chicks, Pearl Jam, Aerosmith, Tony Bennett, and Ozzy Osbourne, amongst other music giants. This is his story--a story of the modern music industry, from Elvis to the iPod--through the eyes of the man who made much of it happen. HITMAKER recounts how a kid from the Bronx--and a college dropout--became one of the music industry's most creative and controversial CEOs. For the first time, Tommy lays bare the facts behind the most sensational aspects of his life, such as being married to and developing the career of Mariah Carey, managing Michael Jackson's emotional ups and downs, and the power struggle with his onetime boss and mentor Walter Yetnikoff. HITMAKER will take you inside this world of power, money, and fame as he recounts the fascinating dealings with countless icons, and what it was like to be at the top when the business suddenly changed. Tommy's story is one that will never be duplicated--and here it is, in his own voice, for the first time.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0446585181"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780446585187"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 400, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZhqbuAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZhqbuAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=ZhqbuAAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0446585181&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=ZhqbuAAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0446585181&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Hitmaker.html?hl=&id=ZhqbuAAACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ZhqbuAAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This is his story--a story of the modern music industry, from Elvis to the iPod--through the eyes of the man who made much of it happen."}}]}

TOP OF THE MORNING When America wakes up with personable and charming hosts like Matt Lauer, Robin Roberts, and George Stephanopoulos, it's hard to imagine their show bookers having to guard a guest's hotel room all night to prevent rival shows from poaching. But that is just part of the intense reality New York Times staff writer Brian Stelter reveals in TOP OF THE MORNING--a gripping look at the most competitive time slot in television, complete with Machiavellian booking wars and manic behavior by the producers, executives, and stars. Stelter is behind the scenes as Ann Curry replaces Meredith Vieira on the Today show, only to be fired a year later in a fiasco that made national headlines. He's backstage as Good Morning America launches an attack to dethrone Today and end the longest consecutive winning streak in morning television history. And he's there as Roberts is diagnosed with a crippling disease-on what should be the happiest day of her career. Featuring exclusive material about current and past morning stars like Katie Couric and all the major players of the 2000s, TOP OF THE MORNING illuminates what it takes to win the AM, when every single viewer counts, tons of jobs are on the line, and hundreds of millions of dollars are at stake. Among the questions Stelter answers for the first time: Why did NBC really decide to oust Curry from her chair? What was her replacement Savannah Guthrie's reaction? Was Matt Lauer really at fault?

As they had done throughout Europe, the Nazis could now plunder the masterpieces of the Renaissance, the treasures of the Vatican, and the antiquities of the Roman Empire. On the eve of the Allied invasion, General Dwight Eisenhower empowered a new kind of soldier to protect these historic riches. In May 1944 two unlikely American heroes\u2014artist Deane Keller and scholar Fred Hartt\u2014embarked from Naples on the treasure hunt of a lifetime, tracking billions of dollars of missing art, including works by Michelangelo, Donatello, Titian, Caravaggio, and Botticelli. With the German army retreating up the Italian peninsula, orders came from the highest levels of the Nazi government to transport truckloads of art north across the border into the Reich. Standing in the way was General Karl Wolff, a top-level Nazi officer. As German forces blew up the magnificent bridges of Florence, General Wolff commandeered the great collections of the Uffizi Gallery and Pitti Palace, later risking his life to negotiate a secret Nazi surrender with American spymaster Allen Dulles.

When President Gerald Ford ordered these aphorisms distributed to his White House staff in 1974, the collection became known as \"Rumsfeld's Rules.\" First gathered as three-by-five cards in a shoebox and then typed up and circulated informally over the years, these eminently nonpartisan rules have amused and enlightened presidents, business executives, chiefs of staff, foreign officials, diplomats, and members of Congress. They earned praise from the Wall Street Journal as \"Required reading,\" and from the New York Times which said: \"Rumsfeld's Rules can be profitably read in any organization\u2026The best reading, though, are his sprightly tips on inoculating oneself against that dread White House disease, the inflated ego.\" Meanwhile, the collection continued to grow as Rumsfeld added new rules derived from things he read, heard, or observed in more than eight decades of a remarkable life. Now these legendary rules are made available for the first time to corporate executive. Rumsfeld has selected his most useful and important rules for effective leadership, enhanced with fresh insights and entertaining anecdotes, and discusses them in the blunt and witty style that made his Pentagon press conferences \"must-see TV.\" Distilled from a career of unusual breadth and accomplishment, and organized under practical topics like hiring people, running a meeting, and dealing with the press, Rumsfeld's Rules can benefit people at every stage in their careers and in every walk of life, from aspiring politicos and industrialists to recent college graduates, teachers, and business leaders. The book provides unprecedented insight into leadership, management, strategy, and life\u2014thinking that not only helped Rumsfeld lead the Pentagon in wartime, but earned him a reputation as one of America's toughest and most effective CEOs.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0062272853"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780062272850"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 352, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 2, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WT-bkwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WT-bkwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=WT-bkwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0062272853&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=WT-bkwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0062272853&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Rumsfeld_s_Rules.html?hl=&id=WT-bkwEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=WT-bkwEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The book provides unprecedented insight into leadership, management, strategy, and life\u2014thinking that not only helped Rumsfeld lead the Pentagon in wartime, but earned him a reputation as one of America&#39;s toughest and most effective CEOs."}}]}

The only autobiography authorized by Jenni Rivera \"I can\u2019t get caught up in the negative because that destroys you. Perhaps trying to move away from my problems and focus on the positive is the best I can do. I am a woman like any other, and ugly things happen to me like any other woman. The number of times I have fallen down is the number of times I have gotten up.\" These are the last words that beloved Mexican American singer Jenni Rivera spoke publicly before boarding the plane that would crash and cut her life short on December 9, 2012. However, they are not the final words that La Diva de la Banda had for the world. Those are found in the pages you hold in your hands, Jenni\u2019s own account of the highs and lows of her extraordinary journey. She became the most acclaimed Spanish-language singer in the United States and sold more than 15 million records worldwide. A single mother of five and grandmother of two, she was also an actress, a television producer, the star of her own reality show, and an entrepreneur. But for all its immense success, Jenni\u2019s life often seemed to be a series of personal battles in which perseverance was her only weapon. As her fame grew, she made it her mission to speak about her struggles, forging an intimate connection with her fans. She became a figure of strength and a source of encouragement to women of all ages. In Unbreakable, Jenni recounts the crucial moments in her past, revealing her experiences with domestic and sexual abuse, divorce, body image issues, making her way in a male-dominated industry, raising her children as a single mother, and learning that she could depend only on herself. Though she is no longer with us, Jenni will always be the \"Rivera rebel from Long Beach,\" the girl who maintained her sense of humor and fighting spirit in every circumstance. In this remarkable memoir, Jenni leaves behind a legacy of inspiration and determination that will forever live on through her precious family, friends, and fans.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1476746079"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781476746074"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 240, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t94BmQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t94BmQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=t94BmQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1476746079&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=t94BmQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1476746079&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Unbreakable.html?hl=&id=t94BmQEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=t94BmQEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "&quot; These are the last words that beloved Mexican American singer Jenni Rivera spoke publicly before boarding the plane that would crash and cut her life short on December 9, 2012."}}]}

Three thousand years ago on a battlefield in ancient Palestine, a shepherd boy felled a mighty warrior with nothing more than a stone and a sling, and ever since then the names of David and Goliath have stood for battles between underdogs and giants. David's victory was improbable and miraculous. He shouldn't have won. Or should he have? In David and Goliath, Malcolm Gladwell challenges how we think about obstacles and disadvantages, offering a new interpretation of what it means to be discriminated against, or cope with a disability, or lose a parent, or attend a mediocre school, or suffer from any number of other apparent setbacks. Gladwell begins with the real story of what happened between the giant and the shepherd boy those many years ago. From there, David and Goliath examines Northern Ireland's Troubles, the minds of cancer researchers and civil rights leaders, murder and the high costs of revenge, and the dynamics of successful and unsuccessful classrooms---all to demonstrate how much of what is beautiful and important in the world arises from what looks like suffering and adversity. In the tradition of Gladwell's previous bestsellers---The Tipping Point, Blink, Outliers and What the Dog Saw---David and Goliath draws upon history, psychology, and powerful storytelling to reshape the way we think of the world around us.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0316204366"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780316204361"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 320, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Psychology"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 3795, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oqFdlwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oqFdlwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=oqFdlwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0316204366&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=oqFdlwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0316204366&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/David_and_Goliath.html?hl=&id=oqFdlwEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=oqFdlwEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Gladwell begins with the real story of what happened between the giant and the shepherd boy those many years ago."}}]}

For more than two decades, psychologist and journalist Daniel Goleman has been scouting the leading edge of the human sciences for what's new, surprising, and important. In Focus, he delves into the science of attention in all its varieties, presenting a long-overdue discussion of this little-noticed and underrated mental asset that matters enormously for how we navigate life. Attention works much like a muscle: use it poorly and it can wither; work it well and it grows. In an era of unstoppable distractions, Goleman persuasively argues that now more than ever we must learn to sharpen focus if we are to contend with, let alone thrive in, a complex world. Goleman analyzes attention research as a threesome: inner, other, and outer focus. A well-lived life demands that we be nimble at each. Goleman shows why high-performers need all three kinds of focus, as demonstrated by rich case studies from fields as diverse as competitive sports, education, the arts, and business. Those who excel rely on what Goleman calls smart practice\u2014such as mindfulness meditation, focused preparation and recovery from setbacks, continued attention to the learning curve, and positive emotions and connections\u2014that help them improve habits, add new skills, and sustain excellence. Combining cutting-edge research with practical findings, Focus reveals what distinguishes experts from amateurs and stars from average performers. Ultimately, Focus calls upon readers not only to pay attention to what matters most to them personally, but also to turn their attention to the pressing problems of the wider world, to the powerless and the poor, and to the future, not just to the seductively simple demands of the here and now.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0062114867"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780062114860"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 320, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Psychology"], "averageRating": 2.5, "ratingsCount": 6, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qQQxlwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qQQxlwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=qQQxlwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0062114867&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=qQQxlwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0062114867&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Focus.html?hl=&id=qQQxlwEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=qQQxlwEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Ultimately, Focus calls upon readers not only to pay attention to what matters most to them personally, but also to turn their attention to the pressing problems of the wider world, to the powerless and the poor, and to the future, not just ..."}}]}

In this monumental history, Simon Winchester addresses these questions, bringing together the breathtaking achievements of those American pioneers who helped to forge and unify the new nation, and who toiled fearlessly to bond the citizens and geography of the United States from its very beginnings. This sweeping narrative details how these daring men, some famous, some forgotten, left their mark on America's natural landscapes, through courage, ingenuity, and hard work. Winchester follows the footsteps of America's most crucial innovators, thinkers, and explorers, from Lewis and Clark and the leaders of the Great Surveys of the West to the builders of the first transcontinental railroad and the curmudgeonly civil engineer who oversaw the creation of more than three million miles of highway. Winchester travels across vast swaths of the American landscape, from Pittsburgh to Portland, Seattle to Anchorage, Truckee to Laramie, using the five classical elements\u2014Wood, Earth, Water, Fire, and Metal\u2014to chart the contributions these adventurous leaders made to connect the diverse communities within the United States and ensure the future of the American project begun in 1776.

During this time he has broken into a Space Station with a Swiss army knife, disposed of a live snake while piloting a plane, and been temporarily blinded while clinging to the exterior of an orbiting spacecraft. The secret to Col. Hadfield's success-and survival-is an unconventional philosophy he learned at NASA: prepare for the worst-and enjoy every moment of it. In An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth, Col. Hadfield takes readers deep into his years of training and space exploration to show how to make the impossible possible. Through eye-opening, entertaining stories filled with the adrenaline of launch, the mesmerizing wonder of spacewalks, and the measured, calm responses mandated by crises, he explains how conventional wisdom can get in the way of achievement-and happiness.

But almost none have thought to ask: What are the effects of children on their parents? In All Joy and No Fun, award-winning journalist Jennifer Senior tries to tackle this question, isolating and analyzing the many ways in which children reshape their parents' lives, whether it's their marriages, their jobs, their habits, their hobbies, their friendships, or their internal senses of self. She argues that changes in the last half century have radically altered the roles of today's mothers and fathers, making their mandates at once more complex and far less clear. Recruiting from a wide variety of sources\u2014in history, sociology, economics, psychology, philosophy, and anthropology\u2014she dissects both the timeless strains of parenting and the ones that are brand new, and then brings her research to life in the homes of ordinary parents around the country. The result is an unforgettable series of family portraits, starting with parents of young children and progressing to parents of teens. Through lively and accessible storytelling, Senior follows these mothers and fathers as they wrestle with some of parenthood's deepest vexations\u2014and luxuriate in some of its fi nest rewards. Meticulously researched yet imbued with emotional intelligence, All Joy and No Fun makes us reconsider some of our culture's most basic beliefs about parenthood, all while illuminating the profound ways children deepen and add purpose to our lives. By focusing on parenthood, rather than parenting, the book is original and essential reading for mothers and fathers of today\u2014and tomorrow.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0062072226"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780062072221"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 320, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Social Science"], "averageRating": 4.0, "ratingsCount": 9, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=d3J3lwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=d3J3lwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=d3J3lwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0062072226&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=d3J3lwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0062072226&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/All_Joy_and_No_Fun.html?hl=&id=d3J3lwEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=d3J3lwEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "\u201cSalted with insights and epigrams, the book is argued with bracing honesty and flashes of authentic wisdom\u2026[an] excellent book.\u201d \u2014Andrew Solomon, The New York Times Book Review &quot;[A] richly woven, entertaining, enlightening, ..."}}]}

YOUNG MONEY Inside the Hidden World of Wall Street's Post-Crash Recruits YOUNG MONEY is the inside story of this well-guarded world. Kevin Roose, New York magazine business writer and author of the critically acclaimed The Unlikely Disciple, spent more than three years shadowing eight entry-level workers at Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, and other leading investment firms.

Roose's young bankers are exposed to the exhausting workloads, huge bonuses, and recreational drugs that have always characterized Wall Street life. But they experience something new, too: an industry forever changed by the massive financial collapse of 2008. And as they get their Wall Street educations, they face hard questions about morality, prestige, and the value of their work.

When things get truly scary, like finding herself stuck next to a passenger with bad breath, she knows she can rely on her family to make matters even worse. Thank goodness she has the devoted Chunk by her side-except for the time she loses him in Telluride.

After having a nationally televised panic attack on Good Morning America, Dan Harris knew he had to make some changes. A lifelong nonbeliever, he found himself on a bizarre adventure, involving a disgraced pastor, a mysterious self-help guru, and a gaggle of brain scientists. Eventually, Harris realized that the source of his problems was the very thing he always thought was his greatest asset: the incessant, insatiable voice in his head, which had both propelled him through the ranks of a hyper-competitive business and also led him to make the profoundly stupid decisions that provoked his on-air freak-out. We all have a voice in our head. It\u2019s what has us losing our temper unnecessarily, checking our email compulsively, eating when we\u2019re not hungry, and fixating on the past and the future at the expense of the present. Most of us would assume we\u2019re stuck with this voice \u2013 that there\u2019s nothing we can do to rein it in \u2013 but Harris stumbled upon an effective way to do just that. It\u2019s a far cry from the miracle cures peddled by the self-help swamis he met; instead, it\u2019s something he always assumed to be either impossible or useless: meditation. After learning about research that suggests meditation can do everything from lower your blood pressure to essentially rewire your brain, Harris took a deep dive into the underreported world of CEOs, scientists, and even marines who are now using it for increased calm, focus, and happiness. 10% Happier takes readers on a ride from the outer reaches of neuroscience to the inner sanctum of network news to the bizarre fringes of America\u2019s spiritual scene, and leaves them with a takeaway that could actually change their lives.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "0062265423"}, {"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9780062265425"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 256, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Self-Help"], "averageRating": 4.0, "ratingsCount": 3304, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gIpSnwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gIpSnwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=gIpSnwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0062265423&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=gIpSnwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0062265423&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/10_Happier.html?hl=&id=gIpSnwEACAAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "embeddable": false, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=gIpSnwEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "NONE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "After learning about research that suggests meditation can do everything from lower your blood pressure to essentially rewire your brain, Harris took a deep dive into the underreported world of CEOs, scientists, and even marines who are now ..."}}]}

His urgent report is current. It covers the plight of women and girls-strangled at birth, forced to suffer servitude, child marriage, genital cutting, deprived of equal opportunity in wealthier nations and \"owned\" by men in others. And the most vulnerable, along with their children, are trapped in war and violence. He addresses the adverse impact of distorted religious texts on women, by Protestants, Catholics, Jews, and Muslims. Special verses are often omitted or quoted out of context to exalt the status of men and exclude women. In a remark that is certain to get attention, Carter points out that women are treated more equally in some countries that are atheistic or where governments are strictly separated from religion. Carter describes his personal observations of the conditions and hardships of women around the world. He describes a trip in Africa with Bill Gates, Sr. and his wife, where they are appalled by visits to enormous brothels. He tells how he joined Nelson Mandela to plead for an end to South Africa's practice of outlawing treatments to protect babies from AIDS-infected mothers. Throughout, Carter reports on observations of women activists and workers of The Carter Center. This is an informed and passionate charge about human rights abuses against half the world's population. It comes from one of the world's most renowned human rights advocates.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781476773957"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1476773955"}], "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "pageCount": 211, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Political Science"], "averageRating": 3.5, "ratingsCount": 5, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": false, "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2P8dAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2P8dAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=2P8dAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:1476773955&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=2P8dAwAAQBAJ&dq=isbn:1476773955&hl=&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Call_to_Action.html?hl=&id=2P8dAwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=2P8dAwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Looks at the suffering, discrimination, and abuse suffered by women throughout the world, often as a result of distorted readings of religious texts, as witnessed by the author and the testimony of women representing different regions and ..."}}]}
